            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU are known to be a Perſon of a very Charitable and Generous Spirit, ready and deſirous to oblige the publick: yet had you been aware your commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Book, would
<pb facs="tcp:51153:3"/> have drawn upon you the trouble of this addreſs, it may well be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would not have kept it ſecret to your ſelf, without promoting its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divulg'd in our vulgar tongue, for the benefit of others. But Sir, that you may not repent this good deed, I will ſpare you as much as is poſſible, and leave it ſtill to publick fame to proclaim your great worth: only pray give me leave to offer that to you, to which you had
<pb facs="tcp:51153:3"/> moſt right. It will not only be an Act of juſtice, but a kindneſs alſo to them that love good Books: For they will be ſure this is one, when they ſhall know, ſo Pious and ſo Learned a man, hath recommended it for ſuch. And I may well expect, this will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with others to read it gladly, when it was that made me undertake the greater trouble of Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it.</p>
            <p>I know not whether I ſhould deprecate for the
<pb facs="tcp:51153:4"/> more than uſual liberty I have in ſome places taken: but Sir, either I could not follow my Reader in his too lofty flight: or elſe I thought plainneſs might be of a more general uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: or it may be I judg'd it convenient that ſpeaking another language, he ſhould ſomewhat alter his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It may be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to win a <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> not now biaſt by worldly Conſiderations: and however 'tis a good work to draw a good man
<pb facs="tcp:51153:4"/> from a bad party. So that I am almoſt confident that what I have done in this, will not only have your pardon, but your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo: and then I ſhall not need fear the cenſure of any judicious Reader.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am well aſſur'd, your name will more than anſwer all the objections that might be raiſed againſt this Book on the account of its Author; as for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, 'tis moſt excellent; and if my Tranſlation be but tolerable, it cannot
<pb facs="tcp:51153:5"/> but do good, and be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all good Chriſtians. I know 'twas your deſign it ſhould, and I wiſh it may: and that this Dedication may be looked upon as a Teſtimony of my great reſpects for you, worthy Sir, whom unknown I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as a Perſon well known to deſerve it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining</p>

            <head>THE Tranſlators Preface TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Know we have great plenty of good Books already, but the number of the bad ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth daily, and we muſt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the tares to choak the good ſeed: for the new ones are read and enquired after, though for nothing but meerly Novelty. I know likewiſe that for the beſt of modern Authors, we need not be beholden to ſtrangers, we have many of our own, more excellent
<pb facs="tcp:51153:6"/> than any can come from abroad: But why ſhould we be greedy of ſuch forein things as miniſter to vanity, and neglect ſuch as advance true goodneſs? Why ſhould we teach Poets and Romancers to ſpeak the Engliſh Tongue, and not acquaint Chriſtian Philoſophers with the graces of it: If I wanted Apologies for this Tranſlation, ſuch as theſe would ſufficiently plead for it: but indeed I rather want words to ſet forth its due praiſe, for 'tis very good in it ſelf, and deſigned to a good end; I mean the inſtructions of it, which if attended to, cannot but be very ſerviceable, in promoting Holineſs and true Religion.</p>
            <p>I know ſome will be ready to ask with <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> John <hi>1.46. Can there any good thing come
<pb facs="tcp:51153:6"/> out of</hi> Nazareth? But I Anſwer with St. <hi>Philip, Come and ſee.</hi> Believe not my report, but come and ſatisfie thy ſelf, and judge as thou ſhalt find cauſe. 'Tis true we may not go to ſchool to the Devil: but we may receive truth from whenceſoever it comes. I mean only that we ſhould not ſeek to diſſenters, to learn from them thoſe things wherein we diſagree: but in thoſe things which we know to be true, we may uſe their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and their aſſiſtance: and we are all agreed that unfeigned ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Chriſtian vertues are abſolutely requiſite to make us true Chriſtians, and to make us happy. We may therefore uſe all ſuch means as tend to this end, without inquiring whence they come; <hi>Iſraelites</hi> may go down to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51153:7"/> to ſharpen their mattocks, their ſhares and their axes: and where we know the right way, there is no danger in being forwarded therein, by any ſtrangers help.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be denied but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintains many Doctrines very injurious to God, and deſtructive of Holineſs and true Piety: but withal, it muſt be granted that many of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers admit not of the direful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents, but ſtill believe and preſs the neceſſity of a good life, and obedience to the Goſpel-precepts: and were it not for this 'twould be impoſſible for any good man to live in ſo erroneous and ſo corrupt a ſociety. But however, fear not to read and to follow the Chriſtian Directions contained in this Book: for it hath paſt
<pb facs="tcp:51153:7"/> through ſuch hands, as would not have made it publick, but for a publick advantage: and withal, it is not ſo much the Authors compoſure, as his Collection from Ancienter and more Orthodox Writers.</p>
            <p>But Bleſſed God! how differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent are the tempers and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures of men? Not a few in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are grieved for, and very ſenſible of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons crept in, and eſtabliſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and yet they are meek and peaceable, ſilent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under their worſt Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and this pureſt of Churches, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt which nothing reaſonable can be objected, is clamour'd againſt, torn and diſtracted, even by ſome that would be thought the beſt of
<pb facs="tcp:51153:8"/> Proteſtants. There they impoſe a heavy yoke, and teach things apparently deſign'd to gratifie their Pride and their Ambition; and yet they are obey'd: here the Church is indulgent, and plainly aims at nothing, but the Salvation of Souls and the Glory of God; and yet it is rebel'd againſt and perſecuted. And I profeſs, but that the Goſpel it ſelf is ſlighted, and Heaven not cared for, I muſt eternally wonder, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not lov'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd, and moſt gladly follow'd, by all that have the happineſs to live within the limits of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, this wonder muſt ceaſe, when we conſider that men can ſtand out againſt the mercies of their Redemption, the infinite
<pb facs="tcp:51153:8"/> Love and Charity of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the glorious rewards and promiſes offered to all that will be true Chriſtians. While men ſhall be ſo ſtupid as to neglect theſe, 'twill be no hard matter to impoſe upon them: and it muſt not ſeem ſtrange that the means are deſpiſed, where the end it ſelf is diſregarded. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil Chriſtians make it their firſt and chiefeſt buſineſs, to ſecure a bleſſed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by living holy lives, it cannot be expected they ſhould make wiſe and ſerious enquiries into thoſe truths which are more diſputable and leſs neceſſary. For the mixing ſecular intereſts with things of Religion, firſt made, and ſtill maintains the errors and breaches of the Chriſtian world: and the way to bring to an end many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
<pb facs="tcp:51153:9"/> is not ſo much to decide as to bury them; at leaſt to make them give place to thoſe things, which are much more plain, and much more requiſite and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</p>
            <p>And here again, I might have a juſt occaſion to commend this Church we live in, for the beſt guide of Souls: for either ſhe meddles not with many diſputes; or elſe ſhe always ſtands on the much ſurer ſide of the queſtion: holding that which even her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries cannot but acknowledge for truth: and never amuſing her Children with unneceſſary ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or unprofitable conteſts. But as it is her great deſign to make us obedient to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and bring us to a ſincere practice of all holy vertues: ſo I
<pb facs="tcp:51153:9"/> ſhall conclude this Preface, with an Exhortation to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>That thou wouldeſt ſeriouſly and often conſider, that thy life is ſhort and uncertain, and that the world paſſeth away, and all things here below: and that thou reſolve thereupon, not to loſe, not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy portion of good things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, for any earthly enjoyment. That thou wouldeſt bear Eternity in mind, and weigh the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of theſe two words, which conclude our Creed, <hi>Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:</hi> and that afterwards thou reſolve carefully to follow the way that leads to it; the Doctrine and Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, who hath purchaſt and promiſt it, to all that love and follow him. Live therefore as one that follows
<pb facs="tcp:51153:10"/> the King of Eternity, to a bleſſed Eternity: and deſpiſe the world. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe diligently ſuch means as will make thee know thy duty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and aſſiſt thee in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it: and amongſt them good Books, which read with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and a deſign to make their goodneſs our own, are very uſeful inſtruments of Vertue and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This I hope will ſomewhat conduce to their advancement; Nay, I am ſure thou ſhalt be much better'd by it, if thou wilt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it with thy Life, as I have with my Pen: and make it thy hearty Endeavour, as I do my Prayer.</p>

            <head>THE Authors Dedication TO ALL TRUE CHRISTIANS.</head>
            <p>WIth due Reverence, I offer this ſmall volume to you bleſſed Souls, veſſels of honour and mercy, elect and holy, Children of God predeſtinated to glory before the foundation of the World: who being redeemed from death by the bloud of Chriſt, and from ſin, by the gift of grace, are not aſham'd to own the deſpiſed Croſs of your Redeemer. For to you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; to you <hi>that are not born of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> You are call'd by the Father
<pb facs="tcp:51153:11"/> to a portion of the inheritance of the Saints in light, that ye might be holy and unreprovable in his ſight in love: and in Chriſt you are choſen, according to the purpoſe and good pleaſure of God, not for your own works and merits. For you the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> prayed, when being ready to leave the world and go to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſaid, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men whom thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were and thou gaveſt them me. I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He prayed not for the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that is in it, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, are not of the Father. And therefore they that are of the world hear not, or at leaſt will not regard and underſtand the words of eternal life, for the natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God. And though Chriſt be the true light which lightens every man
<pb facs="tcp:51153:11"/> that comes into the world, yet the world ſees him not, nor knows him, neither can it receive the ſpirit of truth. On this will be grounded the iuſt judgment of the wicked, <hi>This will be their condemnation, that light came into the world and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil, and every one that doth evil hateth the light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Chriſt was a light in his life and doctrine, he was ſo much more in his ſufferings; he did ſhine on the Croſs moſt gloriouſly to all the world. The tree of death to which he was tyed, became his pulpit whence he preached his divineſt Sermons, teaching us that great leſſon dying, which he ſet while he was alive: <hi>He that doth not take up my Croſs and follow me, cannot be my diſciple.</hi> Therefore to take up our Croſs and follow <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is our greateſt ſafety as well as duty, our ſureſt title to glory; the Croſs is the higheſt pitch of Chriſtian learning, <hi>to know Jeſus Chriſt and him Crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51153:12"/>
            <p>I heartily wiſh that they that ſhall read the enſuing Precepts and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rules may have ſanctified affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and a clear underſtanding, that by the divine grace they may be brought to know and to follow the truth. And my prayer for them is, that God would ſtrengthen them by his good Spirit in the inner man, that love may abound in them more and more, and that they may be ſincere and unblameable, repleniſht with the fruits of righteouſneſs, pleaſing to God in all things, without contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and without offence. I alſo beg for my ſelf of the divine goodneſs, that the glorious light of Chriſt may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and guide my mind, and that his ſtrength may be perfected in my weakneſs, leſt after having preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould become a caſt-away, by acting contrary to my own inſtructions. And therefore I alſo beſeech you, good friends of God, Bleſſed Chriſtians, who are the ſheep of his Paſture, remember me in
<pb facs="tcp:51153:12"/> your Prayers, that what I teach I may fulfil; that the precepts contained in this Book may be my practice, by his divine grace and aſſiſtance, <hi>without whom we can do nothing,</hi> who with the Father and the Holy-Ghoſt, liveth and reigneth one ever glorious and adored God.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the diſtribution of all Chriſtians into three ranks; good, middle-ſort, and bad.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WHen in my meditation as from a watch-tower, I conſider the whole multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the univerſal Church, with their manners and principles, they appear to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51153:25"/> me as divided into three diſtinct bands or orders. The firſt contains them who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed example with a ſincere and hearty affection, and daily reaching forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the higheſt pitch of Evangelical perfection, thereby approve themſelves to be Chriſtians indeed; conſtantly ſerving God, and meditating in his Law, they crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts, and are not caſt down by adverſity, nor puft up by a proſperous fortune. Now among theſe, ſome are more eminent in virtue than the reſt, and ſeem to be even more than men; abſtaining from all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fare, and being temperate even to a perpetual faſt; keeping themſelves pure and unſpotted even to the refuſing of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures; exerciſing themſelves in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſo as to go manfully through fire and the worſt of pains; mortifying and denying themſelves, as being their own enemies; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing wealth and riches, ſo as freely to beſtow in charity all that they poſſeſs; being filled with the love of God, as much as is poſſible in this life; and poſſeſſing all virtues in the higheſt degree, ſo as to be the admiration rather than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, who with ſhame acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their own weakneſs, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how far ſhort they fall of theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Chriſtians. But the number of theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51153:25"/> is not great, and they are commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, <hi>being dead and crucified to themſelves and the world, their converſation being in Heaven, and their life hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the next rank are they who reſt in the profeſſion of the true faith, and think that all Chriſtian duties conſiſt in outward acts; they fear God, and yet retain and worſhip their ſecret Idols; they often come to the Sacrament, but with ſo much unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs and indevotion, that their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent receiving profits them not; they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from great and crying ſins, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect leſſer; outward Acts of Religion they omit not, but their affections are immerſt in the World, they are acted by Self-love and Self-intereſt, and they are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the inward peace and beauty of a Spiritual life; they know not what it is to indeavour after Chriſtian perfection; they are, and will be ſtrangers to that Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſs and renouncing of all things, without which <hi>Chriſt</hi> declares none can be his Diſciple; and ſo ſadly deluded they are, ſo unhappily beſotted with inconſideration, that if you exhort them to a ſtricter and more holy life, they will bid you go and preach to Monks and Hermits, and remain unconcern'd and the ſame as before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the laſt order come all ſuch as are called Chriſtians, onely becauſe born of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51153:26"/> Chriſtian Parents and Baptized; their Lives and Actions being ſcandalous, and they themſelves wicked and abominable, worſe than infidels; of theſe, the number is great and innumerable.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THeſe are they that confeſs God with their mouth and conſtantly deny him with their deeds, who ſo ſtudy to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their appetites, and ſo reſolvedly live after the fleſh and the ſinful cuſtoms of the World, that the revelations and laws of the Goſpel can make no impreſſion on them, they being rather aſham'd and almoſt ſorry that they are Chriſtians. They daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to their Luſts, and their vilanies growing cuſtomary deprive them of all ſenſe of human modeſty. They reliſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Earth; they take their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of good and evil by carnal pleaſures, and they ſo order the courſe of their lives that like brutes they follow nothing but their bodily ſenſes. Riches they value at a mighty rate, and right or wrong ſeek to obtain them; they eſteem nothing baſe and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51153:26"/> unworthy that advanceth their profit or their preferment; and as one ſaid of ſome Greeks, <hi>they build as though they were never to die, and live as if they were weary of their life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This they do, becauſe they believe not what our bleſſed Lord hath reveal'd, and becauſe being unmindful of the uncertainty of our condition, they promiſe themſelves many years to live. They reſt ſatisfied with the injoyment of tranſitory things, which ſoon ſhall be poſſeſt by others: and things that abide for ever they ſlight and neglect, becauſe they think not of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They are tormented by ambition, and weakned by luſt, ſwel'd with pride and rack'd by Envy; Paſſions and unſatiable deſires toſs them to and fro, and they are ſo averſe to all righteouſneſs, that they not only neglect, but even hate the juſt laws of God. <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounceth them Bleſſed that are poor, and mourn, and ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they contrarywiſe eſteem them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that are rich, great and proſperous, and generally honoured by men. <hi>Chriſt</hi> declares that none can be his Diſciple, who is not ready chearfully to forſake all that he hath for him: but theſe men place their affections on their wealth; keep it nigard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, part with it ſorrowfully, and are ever greedy of more, ever ready to invade others right, and to get what they can from them.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51153:27"/>3. Even ſome Profeſſors, that have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their portion, and pretend to be devoted to him, even ſome of theſe there be, who, unmindful of their Sacred Promiſes, indeavour nothing more than to increaſe their wealth, and oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy greater riches under <hi>Chriſt</hi> the great Exemplar of Poverty, than they could have done in a civil Calling under the greateſt Monarch of this World. Neither are ſome of theſe more careful to obey than to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, for inſtead of loving their Enemies, and rendring good for evil to them that hate them, as our Bleſſed Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, they return hatred for ill will, and are ever ready and deſire to revenge the leaſt injuries. Who is there that obeys <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s counſel or injunction of turning the cheek to him that ſmites us, and ſuffering him that ſtrives for our Coat to take our Cloak alſo? or rather who is there that doth not ſlight and deride it? Let who will take an exact account of the Evangelical precepts, and of the obſervers of them, he ſhall find that they are very few that live by the Rules of the Goſpel, few that regard and eſteem it as they ſhould. Nay few there be that care to read or hear it; Fables Romances, and Idle Diſcourſes are generally prefer'd to the Word of God; whereby the vain World make it appear, that they belong not to him whoſe voice they care not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51153:27"/> to hear, that <hi>they hear not God's Words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis the Duty of every Chriſtian faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to believe what God hath revealed, to follow his Counſels, and ſincerely obey his Commands, whence it clearly follows, that he is no Chriſtian who neglects or ſcorns this Duty, for Faith without Works is dead, and except our converſation be ſuitable to our Profeſſion, the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Names and Titles ſhall avail nothing. Life and manners, as well as Faith, make a difference betwixt a Heathen and a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; by Works the diſtinction is made betwixt the true Religion and the falſe. For what manner of Faith is theirs, who ſo believe in God that they deſpiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Commands? are they not like the Devil who believes and trembles? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were to be wiſht that they were no worſe; for his Faith begets an awe and terror, but theſe boaſt of Faith, and yet do not ſo much as fear God.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That original ſin is the ſpring whence all evil proceeds.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. NOW of the cauſe of all this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs none can be ignorant, that hath but heard of the tranſgreſſion of our firſt Parents. For by their fall original Righteouſneſs being loſt, human nature utterly depraved and ſhut up under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, their off-ſpring fell into evils of all ſorts ſo great and ſo many, that they can be neither expreſt nor numbred. Hence that deep and dreadful ignorance which like a black cloud darkens the mind and lies upon it; hence that brutiſh and untam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Luſt which like a heavy weight ſinks the ſoul to the ground and there keeps it faſt; hence that averſion from God, and converſion to things periſhing; hence thoſe anxious cares and fooliſh joys, thoſe diſſenſions, quarrels and enmities, thoſe perverſe Hereſies, greedy Sacrileges, and unſatiable Luſts; and hence the Eternal ruin and damnation of all Mankind. For this was the juſt vengeance of Man's impious Diſobedience and Rebellion, that God ſhould forſake him, who by Pride lift up
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51153:28"/> himſelf againſt God; that he that would not when he could, make a good uſe of his free will, ſhould be depriv'd of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uncapable of doing what was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely his duty and his intereſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, except he be prevented and aſſiſted by the divine grace and mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thus Man left to himſelf in the ſtate of Nature, is by ſelf-love drawn to himſelf, ſeeks himſelf onely, and in his wretched ſelf alone ſets his reſt and his ſatisfaction. This is a ſad truth, and 'tis much to be wiſht all Chriſtians did well conſider and underſtand it, for if they were ſenſible of their weakneſs and impotency, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable they are of themſelves to do any good, then 'tis like they would daily by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer beg his gracious help, that works in us to will and to do; from whom comes all our light, our ſtrength, and our ſufficiency. But alas too many in a deep death-like ſleep, reſt in carnal ſecurity, and unhappily abuſed by vain deluſions, love their blindneſs and their diſeaſe too, dreaming that they are ſafe and ſound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no ſenſe of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. WHileſt I often thought of theſe things, and in the bitterneſs of my Soul call'd to mind the loſt years of my life, I was griev'd and perplext both upon the account of the time which is paſt, and of that which ſhall follow hereafter. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward on thoſe days which are gone, and examining ſeriouſly how I have ſpent them, I was ſeiz'd upon with horror at the ſight of my many ſoul prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the laws of my gracious God, and my great unfaithulneſs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in the breach of thoſe ſacred vows I made when I gave up my name to him, in holy Baptiſm: I was aſham'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded to have thus requited my God, and abuſed his Grace. And when I turn'd my ſelf to the future, to thoſe things that are coming upon me, I could not but dread the dreadful judgments of my offended God, and tremble exceedingly at the greatneſs of my danger, and the uncertainty of that pardon I want, and am ſo much unworthy of. In theſe ſtraights I reſolved by God's help, firſt to help my ſelf, and then others that are in the ſame caſe; to preſcribe what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51153:29"/> might eaſily be had, and yet be effectual; things ready at hand, which being often read and conſidered, might be remembred and follow'd: that they that ſeriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be happy and to take the ſafeſt way that leads to Heaven, might find it here, without the trouble of a long and laborious ſearch.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now becauſe Phyſicians have their <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> and Philoſophers their <hi>Axioms</hi> or ſentences: and in all inquiries after truth, we muſt begin at certain principles, which are ſhort and comprehenſive, and as it were, the ſeed and marrow of the whole diſcipline; therefore I purpoſe in this little book, to lay down briefly and clearly thoſe chiefeſt Rules and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for to lead a holy and a religious life, which more at large are ſcattered in the ſacred books of Divine Scripture, and in the works of the Holy Fathers and other good Authors. For when all is done, this is our firſt and our greateſt concern, that one neceſſary thing on which all depends, to know how to live well, to live like Chriſtians. <hi>For what ſhall a man be profited if he ſhall gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul? and what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Mat. 16.26. Nothing more perverſe and unreaſonable can be imagined, than to own our ſelves <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s diſciples, and live quite contrary to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51153:30"/> example and the precepts of <hi>Chriſt. The name of a Chriſtian will avail nothing, where the life is Antichriſtian.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Cauſe why ſo many learn the Rules of Chriſtianity and follow them not.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. MAny without difficulty can read and learn the Goſpel-precepts, and even often think of them: but 'tis much to be lamented that few underſtand well their force and their full importance. We eaſily grant that the only way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lies through ſelf-denyal, faſting, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying, keeping under the body, and going patiently through many tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but when it comes to the proof of action, we ſeem to be of another mind. We can readily ſay and affirm that it is a Chriſtian's duty chearfully to endure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and perſecutions, torments, and even death it ſelf: but when theſe evils are at hand, and our life comes to be in danger, then things appear not as they did before, we cannot ſee that we are oblig'd to reſignation and ſufferance; what before was a very clear caſe, is now at the beſt but very doubtful. We can be humble when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51153:30"/> no body reviles us: and when wee meet with no vexation then we are patient. We aſſent to the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt injunctions, when we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd: but when they come to regard us, and preſs upon us a preſent duty, then the inticements of luſt, and worldly vanities alter our reſolutions and diſturb our minds; and by a corrupt gloſs or lazy interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we elude the unpleaſing precept.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Truth is as it were, wrapt up in a cloud, and men hate it, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them, their ſinful depraved nature cannot abide its rigour and auſterity. They find in virtue ſomething rough and bitter, and in ſin a mixture of ſweetneſs; that offends, and this gratifies their diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red palat, and they brutiſhly follow the bait, run into all diſſolution, and ſo reject truth to imbrace a lie. If at any time they give ear to an honeſt and plain monitor who lays the truth open before them, and be ſo far work'd upon, as to be ſenſible that they are in darkneſs, and to have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after light: yet like men that would fain awake, but are oppreſt by a heavy ſlumber, and ſo preſently fall to ſleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; they ſoon after cloſe their eyes, and exclude the light, to return to their beloved darkneſs.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51153:31"/> to them, but only to Clergy-men or ſuch as are ſhut up and recluſe from the World; this is their excuſe and their plea, but as I ſhall ſoon make it appear, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether void of truth and vain. For though it is to be acknowledg'd, that ſome by new vows and ingagements are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly devoted to God, and under greater obligations to live Religiouſly and tend to perfection; yet certain it is that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians tend to the ſame end, though their way may differ in ſome circumſtances: and as to what regards the practice of Chriſtian virtues, contempt of the World, poverty in Spirit, and the loving and bearing of the Croſs, they are all equally concern'd; they have the ſame Goſpel, and are equally oblig'd to obey its dictates. Charity which is the band of perfection, comprehenſive of all other duties, God requires of all Chriſtians alike: and luſt or ſelf-love which is the root of all evil, is likewiſe generally forbidden; no exception of perſons; no difference is made betwixt any. Our Bleſſed Saviour hath injon'd we ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from idle words, of which an account ſhall be rendred in the great day, that we ſhould not be angry with our Brother, nor covet what belongs to him; he makes no diſtinction betwixt Clergy-men or Lay-men, or perſons of any rank or calling; nor yet when he ſays, Woe unto you that laugh
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51153:32"/> and bleſſed are ye that mourn: nor when he teaches that we muſt always pray, that we muſt forſake all and follow him, that we muſt hate our own life, deny our ſelves, ſuffer injuries patiently, and enter in at the ſtraight gate; in theſe conſiſts Chriſtian perfection, and yet from theſe he excludes no man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe writing to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſuch as were cumbered with worldly affairs, and had the care of large families, gives them this ſtrict Aſcetick Rule, <hi>to be content with food and raiment.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.8. Than which nothing more was ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any Hermits. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo exhorts all believers, <hi>to be holy in all manner of converſation, as he that hath called them is holy.</hi> 1 Ep. 1.15.

                     <p n="1">1. NOW then let us deſpiſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all thoſe things, wherein worldings place their felicity, and make it our onely ſtudy to purſue after the prize of our high calling, the height of Chriſtian perfection, in following the bleſſed ſteps of our Bleſſed Redeemer. This is the aim of this little volume; to this purpoſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd all the inſtructions here laid down, that we may overcome the temptations and allurements of ſenſe, attain to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo return in ſome manner to our primitive ſtation, that Paradiſe wherein we were created, to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over ſin, and at laſt reign to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The children of this World would fain have it believ'd, that that perfection or ſincerity which the Goſpel requires, is very hard to come by, and hardly to be found in any man living, thereby endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51153:33"/> to make Chriſtians faint and remiſs, loth to venture upon an attempt, which they would have them think is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: whereas nothing is difficult to him that is truly reſolv'd and willing, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is hard in it ſelf, is made eaſie by that grace of God, which is always ready to aſſiſt us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The truth is, there is ſo much of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious beauty in virtue and righteouſneſs, ſo raviſhing a joy in a glimpſe of heavenly light, ſo glorious a brightneſs in the ſight of God's eternal truth, that the enjoyment of theſe for one day, may juſtly be prefer'd to many ages of the greateſt pleaſures this world can afford, <hi>for one day in thy Courts is better than a thouſand,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now here would I caution my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not to wonder, if perchance he finds the ſame thing repeated more than once in this little book, for that cannot be avoided, there being ſo cloſe a connexion and affinity betwixt the precepts of ſeveral virtues: and withal it may be an effect of the great power of truth, that the nearer we view it, the oftner we are drawn to review it. Likewiſe if ſomething herein ſeems too Angelical and high, or more harſh and difficult than the frail nature of man can well bear, let him remember that the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffers violence, and that the ſufferings

                     <p n="1">1. IT is not to be thought nor expreſt how ignorant and careleſs many Chriſtians remain about their great and laſt end; if there were no Eternity, and if nothing after this life were to be fear'd or hoped for, they could not live more looſely than they do. Few they are that ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that their great intereſt and their chiefeſt buſineſs which ſhould take place of all other, is to attain their proper end; that end which is deſired for it ſelf, and beyond which we ſhall wiſh for nothing, of which <hi>S. Philip</hi> ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father and it ſufficeth us:</hi> For this end, which is God, the beatifical vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him, will be al-ſufficient, becauſe that it will have no end; all other things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51153:34"/> are meer trifles, vanities and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The very ſhape of our bodies doth admoniſh us of the end for which we were born; for God made us with our face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that looking up to heaven, we might know that thence is our origine, and that there is our reſt and countrey. And yet for all this, many like brutes look down and grovel upon the ground, and can reliſh nothing, nor deſire nothing, but what is earthly; nay more, like men in a deep lethargy, they can hardly be waked by the loudeſt clamours and the fear of a rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approaching fire; and what is worſt of all, if they ſomewhat lift up their head, and ſpeak imperfectly two or three words of ſenſe, they ſoon fall again into their ſlumber, and no longer will hear, or mind what concerns their life and ſafety.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is the counſel of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Mat. 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> but we ſlighting and neglecting that bleſſed Kingdom, ſeek for mony, pleaſures, and preferments, and mind nothing elſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>one thing is neceſſary,</hi> Luke 10.42. but we cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ſelves about many things, which for the moſt part are only hindrances to our ſalvation. He commands us, Mat. 7.12. <hi>To do that to others, which we would they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51153:34"/> ſhould do unto us:</hi> But we generally do thoſe things to them, which we would think moſt grievous to ſuffer our ſelves. He forbids <hi>us to judge,</hi> Mat. 7.1. But we love to cenſure others, and to condemn them very ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we take notice of motes in their eyes, and perceive not beams in our own: and to ſum up all in this, he requires we would love him above all things, <hi>with all our heart and ſoul,</hi> Mat. 22.37. But we dote on pelf and riches; we are lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God; to him we prefer any thing that gratifies our luſts and our ſinful affections. Thus, in as much as in us lies, we make the preaching of the Croſs to be of none effect, the Incarnation of the Son of God to be to no purpoſe, and ſacraments to be vain and inſignificant: becauſe we will live as if we had no knowledge of God, no thoughts of heaven nor hell, no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our latter end. The life of every creature conſiſteth in acting ſutable to its own nature; now that which we are to do, as men, wherein properly conſiſts our duty and our dignity, is to know God, and to love him: therefore to be imployed in this, is our proper work, our life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; to do any thing elſe, is vain and uſeleſs; and to do any thing contrary, is infinitely pernicious.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The reaſons why all men are not happy, being they all deſire it.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IT is the conſtant ſenſe and deſign of all men that can uſe their reaſon, to aſpire after happineſs; but what that is, there are and have been many opinions and diſputes; and Philoſophers have ſpent much time and induſtry to find out the way to Bleſſedneſs, the deſire whereof is natural, and common to all, of what parts or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions ſoever. Yet Chriſtians alone know it, they being taught by the doctrine of Faith, that God is the fountain of all feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the fulfilling of all rational deſires, that <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> or laſt end, which is to be prefer'd and lov'd, and ſought before all other things, as that wherein alone we can find perfect reſt and ſatisfaction. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding 'tis to be confeſt and ſadly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed that multitudes of Chriſtians are ſo wilfully blind and perverſe, that though they paſſionately wiſh for happineſs, yet they do nothing whereby to obtain it. They are ſo groſly cheated by a falſe appearance of Bliſs, the deceit and illuſions of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that they aſpire to nothing above ſenſe, and therefore they would, and yet cannot
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51153:35"/> be happy, becauſe they aim not at the right end; their actions and purſuits have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to miſery, and thither neceſſarily lead them, though it be much againſt their will.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As in a circle, though never ſo ample, there is but one center, which being alone in the middle, ſeems to have dominion over all the lines that can be drawn from the circumference, and to be their proper place of reſt: thus is God the one onely center and reſt of our ſouls, and if they turn from him, they may wander eternally, other objects being finite and altogether unſatisfying. Therefore God requires only that we ſhould ſeek after him, becauſe that alone is abſolutely required to our well-being. Whatever elſe is wanting, we may be well without it; life it ſelf is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: and if not life, much leſs leſſer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. And ſo he that lives as he ſhould, aiming at his right end, muſt live to God alone, to ſerve and to glorifie him. For this is the nature of man, and a law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to him which cannot be changed, that he that deſires and purſues after that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, eternal, uncreated good, thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes happy: whereas he that any ways turns from it, becomes neceſſarily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. IN that we are pilgrims and travellers going to our countrey, it is altogether neceſſary we ſhould always advance thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſeriouſly inquire whether we follow the right way, whither we are going, what end we propound to our ſelves in all our labours, and what it is we now aim at by our preſent ſtudies and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: for man undertakes nothing, but to a certain end and purpoſe, which the better it is, the better alſo is the undertaking; it is a good intention that makes a good work, and that good intention is that, which is directed by the rule of faith. It is the voice of the wicked, Wiſd. 2.6. <hi>Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are preſent.</hi> Whereas the beſt of creatures are only for uſe; and God alone for enjoyment. The Creatures are as ſo many ſteps, or rounds of a ladder whereby we might aſcend up to God; thus at leaſt he intended it: but by our depravation and folly, they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51153:36"/> became obſtacles in our way to him, they turn us from the path to life and happineſs, and as the Wiſeman ſaith, Wiſd. 14.11. <hi>The creatures of God become ſtumbling blocks to the ſouls of men, and a ſnare to the feet of the unwiſe.</hi> Of the unwiſe, he ſaith, ſuch as will not take God for their guide, ſuch as turn their eyes from his glorious light, to enjoy the ſhade and obſcurity of creatures: thereby falling in love with darkneſs, and ſo becoming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ever abiding the divine ſaving light.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now if all creatures are created for this, to be as helps and means whereby we may obtain our end, then are we to take off our affections from them, to place them upon the Creator, who is the end we ſhould aim at. For the end ſhould be lov'd and deſir'd without end, and without compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor, in goodneſs being independent, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and alone ſatisfactory: whereas means have no farther goodneſs, than as they help to obtain the end. A Chriſtian ſhould therefore refer to God all his thoughts, and words, and actions, and that, not lazily or verbally only: but with a ſtrong affection, and with a pure heart: avoiding thereby the cheat men often put upon themſelves, in being deceiv'd with their own formalities and ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, when even in Religion and ſpiritual exerciſes, they often ſeek and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51153:37"/> rather than God. Upon this account the Scripture calls the way to life, ſtraight and narrow, becauſe depraved man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all to himſelf, and can hardly follow the pure and direct ways which God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, being naturally averſe to an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right intention. But when this averſion is once overcome, by an aſſiduous diligence and delight in the law of God, then divine commandments are not grievous, the way to life is wide, and the yoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is light and pleaſant.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THat the number of fools is paſt number, was rightly affirmed by the Wiſe man: For indeed infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men trifle away their days ſo ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, act ſo childiſhly, or rather ſo much like mad men, that their intolerable follies cannot be ſufficiently deplor'd.

If a ſuit at law is to be determin'd, or an eſtate gain'd, or a place of honour obtain'd, then they ſpare no coſt nor labour, no ſearch, no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, no ſtudy: but if Heaven is to be purchaſt, and eternal life and glory made ſure, then no man ſtirs; they are all aſleep and unactive; no regard, no care is had of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In things that touch and afflict the body, as hunger and thirſt, heat and cold, pains and infirmities, our ſenſes are quick, and can never be deceiv'd: and therefore with all our might and induſtry, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently occur to thoſe evils, and endeavour to remove them. But if our ſoul ſuffers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame or the like ſpiritual evils, we are not ſenſible, and we care no more, than if that nobler part of us whereby we live, and are rational and like to Angels, had no being at all. And this, becauſe the fleſh hath got the upper hand: and we value this ſport, uncertain life, more than life eternal: and we make it our firſt and ſole employment to reſcue that carcaſs from death, for a few moments, which certainly muſt ſoon become its prey.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. One cauſe of theſe prepoſterous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is the groſs and brutiſh ignorance, or rather inconſideration of too too many,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51153:38"/> who will neither know nor conſider, to what end man was created, what it is he ſhould ſeek and deſign in the whole courſe of his life, and what way he ſhould take that he may not miſs of his great aim, Jer. 12.11. <hi>The whole land is made deſolate becauſe no man lays it to heart,</hi> i. e. becauſe no man conſiders wiſely. Another cauſe of this miſchief, is the great number and power of thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that perpetually aſſault us, whoſe ſnares no man can poſſibly avoid, without God breaks them, and delivers him: for we are continually beſieg'd by a frail fleſh, a flattering world, and legions of devils, <hi>who ſeek to devour us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, our folly and miſery proceeds partly from our blindneſs; the whole World being in darkneſs, we want light to guide us, and yet will not beg it of God, and pray him devoutly, he would lead us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, who alone is able and willing to do it: and partly from our ſloth and inconſtancy; for we are vertuous in wiſh and not in effect, becauſe we are lazy to work, and when it comes to the practice, we find difficulties, and being ſoon tir'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned, haſtily give over, before we have effected any thing. All Chriſtians no doubt would be glad to come at laſt to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but they have no heart to come after him: they would be glad to enjoy him, but care not to imitate him: fain would they come to him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51153:38"/> but not follow him. <hi>Men would obtain riches without labour, and Crowns without fighting; they like well of rewards, but they would take no pains.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THis World's felicity put all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with all thoſe things that are moſt eſteem'd by the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the whole is but like a coarſe picture which ſeems to have ſomething pleaſing and inviting, when you look upon't with a falſe light, or in a place ſomewhat obſcure, or with a ſmall blind candle, ſuch as is the dim and deceitful light of preſent time: but if you bring forth the picture, and view it before that glorious ſun that ſhines for ever, the radiant brightneſs of Eternity, there it will appear deform and unfiniſh'd, a dark and imperfect ſhadow which repreſents nothing, a confuſed heap of ſtrokes and lines drawn without order or deſign. For though the light of the Goſpel enlightens the World, yet it remains in darkneſs;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51153:39"/> men will not ſee the glorious diſcoveries which the Goſpel makes; <hi>The light ſhined in the darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet that light it is, and none elſe, that clearly ſhews the great difference betwixt good and evil, btwixt vile and precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt truth and appearances; how we may know and chuſe the one from the other. By this bleſſed light of Chriſtianity which dwells in the heart and inſtructs it, and abides for ever, by it we are taught not to cleave to the creatures becauſe of their attractive beauty: but ſo to conſider their perfections, as to be by them led to the fountain whence they proceed, to the love and admiration of the glorious maker of all things. And the ſame divine light it is, makes me ſee that it is good for me to hold me faſt by my God, and to put in him alone my whole confidence, and not in Princes or Friends, or even Brothers: who as they have all a diſtinct being, have alſo different ends, and ſeek from us every one his own advantage, being ever ready to forſake us, as ſoon as they ſhall think we are become uſeleſs to them. This light therefore we ought gladly to receive and follow, that appearances and pleaſing illuſions put not a cheat upon us, and make us ſeek for happineſs in the creatures which are as if they were not, and have no value, but what the ignorant vulgar attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes

                     <p n="1">1. THE Life of man runs round and ſpends it ſelf within this circle, they eat and drink, they ſleep and wake, that they may return to the ſame again; they ſcrape together as much as they are able, and there is no end of their acquiſts; they will live as merrily as they can, and die as late as poſſible may be; betwixt their baptiſm and the hour of death there lies a confuſed heap of acts of ſin and acts of Religion, of penitent confeſſions and wilful relapſes, of Sacramental vows and breaches of them. No day paſſeth over without they add to the number of their tranſgreſſions; and they all go on heedleſly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51153:40"/> without conſidering what will be the end of their courſe of life; and they all run, when but a few care, how they come to the end of their race: becauſe they conſider not what reward and glory is prepared in Heaven, to them that remain faithful to their Chriſtian engagements, overcoming the world and the fleſh, for to follow <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. God created the whole univerſe, and in it man to his image, giving him an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know his maker, a will to love and obey him, a memory to think of his laws, faculties to ſerve him, and a tongue to praiſe him: but then as he made man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo he created the whole world for man, that he might uſe all things for his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and for the glory of God, the giver of all. But ungrateful man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his duty, drawn by the deceit of voluptuouſneſs, minds only his ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, uſeth or rather abuſeth his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and reaſon, his riches and honours, his health and life and all other enjoyments, to the diſpleaſure and diſhonour of God his gracious benefactor, who freely granted him all thoſe things, that if he would make a good uſe of them, they might be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his preſent eaſe and well being, and of his future eternal happineſs. <hi>So great is the folly and perverſneſs of man, that he abuſeth that to his own ruine, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and gave him for his greater good.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. EVery man that aims at the right end, muſt guide his courſe thither by the meaſures of Eternity, and that in a way ſutable to the circumſtances of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This neceſſary Rule is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by all, for many following their own fancies, unadviſedly forſake that way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Divine providence had brought them, and take ſome other of their own chuſing. Like <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> who, though he much longed to be cur'd of his leproſie, yet refuſed to uſe the eaſie remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Prophet, and preferring what he himſelf had fancied, had gone away in anger diſeaſed as he came, had not his wiſer ſervant hindred it. After this manner, many following their own heads, undertake many things which they cannot perform, but which only vex and diſtract them: being above their abilities, or inconſiſtent with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occupations which they lie under;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51153:41"/> ſo that they can neither act, nor advance towards the deſired end, but ſpend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in unprofitably wiſhing that things were otherwiſe than they are.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But the ſhort and ready way to Bliſs, is that which our Bleſſed Saviour hath ſhew'd us, ſaying, <hi>Let him that will come after me, take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi> His Croſs, he ſaith, not that which was to be another man's burthen; the Croſs which God lays upon him, and hath fitted for him, and given him ſtrength to bear: not that which he fooliſhly ſhall take up, and ſoon after poorly ſink under. Theſe two things muſt therefore carefully be heeded, firſt that a man underſtand perfectly what is the right end at which he ſhould aim; without this, all deliberations concerning the means, are to no purpoſe: and ſecondly that knowing that good end, he keeps his mind intent upon't, and take that plain path towards it, which lies before him, and agrees with his ſtate and condition, therein bearing his Croſs chearfully, as the Lord hath commanded. Now this is every man's Croſs, to diſcharge well the duties of his place and of his ſeveral relations, to bear patiently thoſe afflictions which he daily meets in his way, and conſtantly, by doing better and better that which belongs to his province, to endeavour after the higheſt perfection attainable therein. Every man

                     <p n="1">1. THeſe be the inſeparable properties of the laſt and higheſt end at which man ſhould aim, that it be perfectly good, and perfectly ſatisfactory, ſo that being once obtain'd, nothing elſe is wanted, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe deſir'd; for whoever wants any thing, deſires it alſo, and he that deſires is not ſatisfied, is not yet come to that laſt end beyond which his wiſhes can go no further; that is, is not poſſeſt of God, who alone is infinitely good, and can alone repleniſh all our deſires and capacities. I ſhall be ſatisfied when thy glory appears, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, or <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Pſal. 17.15. that and nothing elſe can perfectly do it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet ſuch is the perverſe and incurable folly of man, that he will have that to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51153:42"/> beſt which he loves beſt; though by the teſtimony of others, and the conviction of his own conſcience he knows it to be evil. And therefore many, either ignorantly or perverſly purſue after that which is good only in appearance, and forſake that which is good indeed. And they thereby become diſorderly, wretched and criminal; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, lovers of the thorny pleaſures of ſin; and lovers of that fatal darkneſs which hides their ſorrows, the ſnares among which they walk, and covers their miſery and danger, ſo that they neither ſee nor fear the dreadful tribunal of that juſt Judge, who will condemn all Apoſtates, that turn from the right way. <hi>They walk,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in the vanity of their mind, having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart: being paſt feeling, they have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to laſciviouſneſs, to work all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.17. <hi>They count their life a market for gain, and ſay, we muſt be getting every way, though it be by evil means,</hi> Wiſd: 15.12. And then it often happens by a juſt judgment, that their faith comes to be as debaucht as their life; that having long ſaid it by their wicked deeds, they at laſt ſay it in their heart, <hi>that there is no God.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51153:42"/>3. I have already, and cannot too often note the cauſe of this evil; that is <hi>Adam,</hi> who by his ſin, not only loſt the uprightneſs of his will, but alſo the true light of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: ſo that in him, who was the ſtock and root whence all men grow, we were depriv'd of both. And now this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the will, inclines man to ſelf-love, vain glory, and an imperious pride; to covetouſneſs, ſloth, ſenſuality and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And in the darkneſs of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding expoſeth him to ignorance, and falſe apprehenſion of things, to doubts, errors and lies, and makes him have an averſion to good and ſerious thoughts. Thus man is become earthly, weak, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd, unable to reſiſt the ſinful motions of his own heart, and unable to know or to attain true felicity: but rather, as it is written, <hi>His ways are always grievous, and God's judgments are far above out of his ſight,</hi> Pſal. 10.5. And he now being alienated from God, to whom all things ſhould be refer'd, is alſo a ſtranger to virtue, which conſiſts in the intention, in being deſign'd to pleaſe God, rather than in the act. But that Soul which by the Grace of our Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is redeem'd from this power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and ſlavery to ſin, is alſo enabled to cleave ſtedfaſtly to God, in whom it enjoys Peace and joy, and full ſatisfaction, all that can make him intirely happy; <hi>for he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51153:43"/> and too unſatiable, to whom God is not ſufficient.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. WHereas reaſon it ſelf teaches, and all men freely confeſs that things to come ſhould be prefer'd to things preſent, heavenly things to things earthly, and things eternal to things that laſt but for a ſhort time: 'tis hard to conceive why ſo many who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and acknowledge this, yet by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtrongly deny it. In worldly matters, and ſuch as concern this preſent life, they are very active, very wiſe and very laborious; in others they ſeem to have neither ſenſe nor reaſon. If you ſpeak to them of God, of Holy-Living and Life Eternal, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you not, or they preſently forget what you ſaid. Things material and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are ſenſible, and therefore more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet by; though oftentimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will force them to know that all human concerns are flitting, uncertain, and very deceitful, yet men follow ſenſe, and they ſoon return to embrace thoſe things which cuſtom and a familiar converſe hath made dear to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51153:43"/>2. The fall (as I ſaid) of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is the head-ſpring whence all this miſchief flows; from it proceed all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as alſo the darkneſs and inconſtancy of our minds: but the more immediate cauſe of it, which I now conſider is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity, depravation and weakneſs of the faculties of our ſouls, which have no right apprehenſion of the things of God, and but an imperfect confuſed notion of the amazing concerns of Eternity. The lovelineſs of virtue and the great deformity of ſin, the terrors of death and the dread of God's righteous judgments, the joys of Saints above, and the grievous torments of the wicked in hell: theſe are but words which we hear, we have dark and narrow conceptions of them, we underſtand not of how great an importance they are, and therefore we are not ſo affected with them, as to be made wiſe unto ſalvation. Of things offer'd to our conſideration, we only mind that leaſt outward part which falls under the reach of ſenſe: but we attend not to that which is leſs ſenſible, though more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and apt effectually to work upon the mind. Thus in ſin, we look moſt of all to what's temporal; we are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the impairing of our ſame and the diminution of our worth or ſelf-complacency, than for having offended God, and made our ſelves obnoxious to an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51153:44"/> infinite pain. Likewiſe in a dying man we moſt obſerve what is in view, outward ſymptomes and accidents, little regarding the more eſſential adjuncts which concern the ſoul, and are of far greater moment. And we conceive of the laſt judgment and the unquenchable flames of Hell, which are imperceptible to ſenſe, as of things which are nothing to us, and which we have no intereſt to mind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame deception alſo extends it ſelf to things preſent which gratifie our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; we take notice only of that outſide which pleaſeth us, and ſo deplorable is our ſottiſh miſtake, that we count our ſelves very happy to enjoy that for a moment, which muſt make us eternally miſerable. Every man knows his Soul is immortal, and many Philoſophers have writ great things upon that ſubject: but where are they that are ſolicitous for its well-being after death? Do not moſt men neglect their ſoul, and live as if it were to die with the body? The miſchief is, that generally men live neither by faith nor by reaſon, they follow blindfold and brutiſhly juſt as ſenſe leads them: <hi>avoiding carefully what is now troubleſom to the fleſh, as if nothing elſe were to be done here, and nothing elſe fear'd hereafter,</hi>

As he that acts the King on the ſtage, though it be but a vain ſhew to delight vainer people, yet is careful to do and to ſpeak nothing but what befits a King: ſo, and much more careful ſhould a Chriſtian be to do nothing unworthy of that honourable name, which makes him a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and diſciple of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and an heir of his Heavenly Kingdom. And as a picture-drawer when he is upon a great deſign, fixes his eyes and mind on that Original

                     <p n="2">2. Now he that profeſſeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in him, ſhould walk as he walked, carefully obſerve and follow the ſteps of his new and better Lord. For as whileſt we remain in the ſtate of Nature and follow its inſtinct, we are Children of wrath, and are ſlaves to Satan and to our own luſts: ſo now we are redeem'd from that unhappy ſlavery by the bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Grace muſt be the principle of all our actions, we muſt carefully follow him whoſe members we are. 1 Cor. 15.47. <hi>The firſt man is of the Earth, earthly; the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven: therefore as we have born the Image of the Earthy, we ſhould alſo bear the Image of the Heavenly;</hi> making that our firſt and chiefeſt care, that we walk worthy of our high calling, as being led by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from whom we have our higheſt title, <hi>for if any man have not the Spirit of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>he is none of his,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51153:46"/> granted by all wiſe men, that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s high Encomium of Wiſdom doth but ſet forth the Divine excellencies of Faith; Wiſd. 7. <hi>Gold in reſpect of her is as little ſand, and ſilver ſhall be counted as clay before her, ſhe is a treaſure unto men, that never faileth, which they that uſe, become the friends of God. She is the brightneſs of the everlaſting light, the unſpotted mirrour of the power of God, and the Image of his goodneſs.</hi> The doctrine of Faith apprehended by Faith teacheth us all Truth, informs our Souls what we ought to love, what to ſhun and what to purſue. It teacheth us that what the world counts good, is evil: And that worldly calamities are good, if indur'd patiently. It teacheth us to deſpiſe things viſible and temporal, and all that which is for no uſe but to the material part of us. It teacheth us to know God and to know our ſelves, which is the true ſaving knowledge, and the higheſt of our wiſdome. And it frees us from the pernicious errors of this fooliſh world, and from its wretched ſlavery, to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, and ſet us at perfect liberty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a vaſt diſtance and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety betwixt the inſtructions of faith and the cuſtoms of this preſent world; but then, <hi>Chriſt</hi> who delivers the firſt, being ever true and infallible, it is clearly our duty and intereſt to live by faith and not by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51153:46"/> ſenſe, to follow the holy light of our holy faith, not the wicked example of this wicked world. And withal 'tis much to be obſerv'd, that depraved as we now are, there is nothing in us, nothing in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but what is contrary to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Faith, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtructive of them. For 'tis the conſtant dictate and endeavour of fleſh and bloud and natural reaſon, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by all means poſſible, a well-being to our ſelves in this preſent world, without taking any further care of a better life, and a bleſſed Eternity. This evil men have from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from thoſe luſts which reign in their mortal bodies, and the beſt of men have ſtill ſome cauſe to groan under the ſenſe of it.

They are like all other things under the Sun periſhing and unſtable, ſo that he that relies on them muſt expect the ſame deſtiny: whereas he that truſts on God who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, is eſtabliſhed for ever. As the Saints that ſee God as he is, become like unto him: ſo ſhould our life expreſs the holineſs of our belief, our actions ſhould be a lively repreſentation of what we ſee by faith: and we ſhould glory in nothing but in the Croſs of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which to the lovers of this preſent world, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and an offence.</p>

This is the ground-work and the true inſtitution of a Chriſtian life, and this is that excellent knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is difficult and unpleaſant to natural men, and contrary to the Spirit of the World. This is the higheſt Philoſophy, which exceeds the capacity and knowledge of the wiſe men of this world; and this is the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the certain way to Bliſs, to know and to follow <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and him crucified; to hate ones ſelf and the world, with all its pleaſures and vanities, and to love poverty, contempt, ſorrows and tribulations. But
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51153:48"/> to underſtand well this plain leſſon, or firſt principle, requires a great meaſure of Grace; and more yet to reliſh it with pleaſure; moſt of all, to practiſe it, to live accordingly in the whole courſe of our converſation.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. ETernal torments being prepar'd for none but ſuch as will be miſerable, and by their free and wilful wickedneſs, chuſe Hell for their portion; on the other ſide, Eternal joys above being offer'd to all that will partake of them: who would not think the Priſons of darkneſs and ſorrow ſhould be wholly empty, and Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely full and throng'd? Who could imagine any man ſhould be ſo deſperately mad, as to chuſe eternal miſery, when he could eaſily be happy for ever? Yet ſo it is, few there are that enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and many there are that go down to Hell; inſomuch that the firſt, compared to theſe, are but a ſmall number, whom our Bleſſed Saviour calls <hi>the little flock.</hi> The folly of men is ſo ſtrange and amazing, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51153:48"/> the greater part of them prefer Eternal woe to Bliſs Eternal, though you ſhall not find one how thirſty ſoever, that would ſip of that cup, he ſhould ſuſpect to be poiſon'd, yet many every where may be found, who greedily commit thoſe ſins, which, not doubts or opinions, but a certain faith aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them, muſt be puniſht with ever-burning flames.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This unheard of madneſs, many attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to want of Faith, which though it may be true of ſome amongſt us, yet daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and obſervation puts it beyond all doubt, that the greater part of them that periſh, periſh for want of conſideration. For though they believe that there is a Hell, and that therein none ſhall ſuffer but ſuch as will enjoy the pleaſures of ſin while they live, yet they ſoon forget this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth; their fancy and their affections are fixt to this earth, they only pleaſe their appetites, and live ſo ſenſually, that their reaſon can hardly look beyond the preſent; the notions of Eternity are kept out, and their underſtanding made uncapable and unwilling to conſider wiſely, that their ſhort joys and delights will ſoon end into bitterneſs and endleſs ſorrows, and that it is very eaſie for us whileſt we live, to avoid that dreadful miſery, and obtain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs. And would to God, men would ſeriouſly mind and obſerve this; O
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51153:49"/> that they were wiſe, that they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and conſider their latter end, and live accordingly. It is man's property and his privilege, to think and meditate, and ſure his thoughts and meditations ſhould of themſelves run, firſt of all, to his chief end, to that which is his own greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.

                     <p n="1">1. HE is a Chriſtian indeed that owns the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and obeys his precepts, and follows his Bleſſed Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for to this we are oblig'd by our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion, to raiſe our ſelves above theſe earthly things, to live a Divine and Heavenly Life. Becauſe that <hi>the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto all men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.) <hi>teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live in this preſent World Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly: looking for that Bleſſed Hope and the glorious appearing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51153:49"/> of the great God and our Saviour</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he cannot juſtly be called Doctor, who is not ſo much as a Scholar; as he deſerves not the name of Captain, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not Souldiery; and as he is not an Artiſt, that hath not the skill of it: <hi>No more can he with truth be called a Chriſtian, who is not a true follower of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They therefore only are truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who having renounc'd the vanities and ſinful deſires of this World, love God with all their heart, and with all their ſtrength, and their neighbour altogether in God and for God, preferring not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any others, becauſe that in our ſecond and better birth we are all made equal: They that ſtrictly obſerve the rules of juſtice and ſobriety; in all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having themſelves ſo innocently as not to give a juſt cauſe of offence to any Perſon: they that uſe the creatures for neceſſity, as ſick men do Phyſick, coveting nothing but that only which cannot be taken away from them: they that ſeek not to pleaſe, and fear not to diſpleaſe any, but God alone: they that hate their own fleſh, in that it is the body of ſin, and therefore daily chaſtize and keep it under, leſt it grow petulant and maſterleſs: they that are ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51153:50"/> to their reſolutions, and being above the World cannot be terrified by any threats or perſecutions: they that in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and adverſity are always the ſame, peaceable and even, able clearly to ſee and to follow truth: they that longing after things Eternal, deſpiſe things preſent, and living upon Faith, Hope and Charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve therefore what they ſee not, hope what they have not, and love that which as yet they do not poſſeſs: they that ſo love God, that for his ſake they refuſe no labour, and are always ready to expoſe themſelves to any dangers, without any other deſign but only to advance his glory: they that from the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and their confidence in Gods mercy, chearfully expect <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming in his Heavenly Kingdom, and can joyfully ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. 4.7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day:</hi> They alone have a right to the Title and the Bleſſedneſs of Chriſtians, that do all theſe with ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. ALL the actions of a Chriſtian ſhould be done in peace and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he ought to conſider the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place and perſons, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51153:51"/> eſpecially of the end of that he is about: but withall let him take care of being raſh and haſty, of following ſudden motions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather than reaſon, Grace and Religion. Let not his mind be light and inconſtant, eaſily wandring after vain projects: but let him attend and be ready to entertain and to obey the illuminations and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the good Spirit: When he is about to begin any work, let not his mind be too buſie and diſtracted with other thoughts, for then he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to want his wits and fail in many things, which afterwards will grieve him, when it will be too late. When he firſt enters upon any deſign, let him humbly beg that God would guide and aſſiſt him, and let him ſeriouſly conſider what ſhare God hath in the buſineſs, and how much of it is on his own account. In the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of his work let not ſelf-complacency turn him from the good end he propoſed: and in the finiſhing thereof let him be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious that all he hath done be not marr'd and ſpoil'd by ſelf-applauſe and vain-glory: above all, let him be ſeriouſly intent upon this, that he ſeeks not the praiſe of men, but the glory of God, keeping down proud thoughts, in the conſideration of his being nothing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ſhould not meddle with any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, except God by his Providence calls
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51153:51"/> him to it; and then he ought to go through with it chearfully and diligently; and with noble deſigns of charity to men, ſpecially to their ſouls: conſidering that the bliſs or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this preſent life, conſiſteth not in the full enjoyment of God, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our will to his, in the doing and ſuffering his pleaſure. Except neceſſity compell him, let him not undertake any thing that's above his ſtrength, that if it be poſſible he may loſe nothing of his peace nor of the freedom of his mind: for to be too intent, and too much taken up with things without us, commonly quencheth the Spirit of God, and deprives our Souls of tranquillity. Rather as the Angel which is ſaid to have accompanied <hi>Tobit,</hi> though it was always ready to ſerve him, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs attended to the will of God, and was always preſent to him: ſo ſhould a good Chriſtian mind the neceſſary concerns of this life, and be outwardly troubled and imployed about them; when yet his heart ſhould be with God, and his ſoul in Heaven, there to be free from the diſtractions and all the affections of the World.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. TO do that which our place and calling requires of us here, and that which will make us happy hereafter, may be ſaid to be one and the ſame thing; for no man more certainly works out his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than he that honeſtly, and diligently works in his proper ſphere. Therefore the Devil commonly lays this ſnare in our way to Chriſtian perfection, to make us aſpire after the doing of great matters which are no parts of our office, thereby to buſie and diſtract our mind, that we may not attend to our proper duty, which lies before us, and the doing whereof is our greateſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He therefore greatly deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that would fain change his condition, imagining he could better ſerve God if he were here or there, or ſo or ſo, after Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or a prudent choiſe have otherwiſe determin'd it. It doth but make him lazy and negligent in doing what he ſhould,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51153:52"/> whileſt he thinks of what belongs not to him; it makes him to ſit idle, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the place where he is, whileſt he projects to do great feats where he is not. Whereas the unblameable integrity or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at which a Chriſtian ſhould aim, depends upon particular actions, they that are negligent and incurious to do them well, ſet themſelves backward and make no progreſs; for their heart being abſent, and their thoughts employ'd ſomewhere elſe, they do but little where they are, and yet that little is done after a dreaming careleſs way. Such men are always beginning, or about to begin to live well; they contrive many things, but bring nothing to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are all leaves and no fruit. <hi>Like Trees that are often remov'd, they no where take firm root, and ſo remain every where uſeleſs.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. CHriſtians ſhould not indulge to the Luſts of the lower belly or to the pleaſures of a nice or gluttonous palat; they ſhould abſtain from all vanity and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51153:53"/> in their Apparel, and from all idle ſports that are too expenſive of time; and their life ſhould be free from ſloth and negligence, from ambition and pride, and from covetouſneſs and deſire of riches. Anger ought not to lodge in their breaſt, and they ſhould never do that to others which they would not have done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They ſhould do nothing careleſly, nor yet raſhly, leaſt of all deceitfully and hypocritically. Chriſtian duties and acts of virtue that are not done in Spirit and Truth, with attention and a good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are meer diſſembling and pageantry. In ſome places where Religion is made a Theatrical repreſentation, you ſhall often find men of wicked lives act the higheſt virtues of the greateſt Saints; one the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Martyrs, another the modeſty of the Bleſſed Virgin, or perhaps the heroick actions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles: but the end of the play puts an end to their fine diſſembling; they no longer appear thoſe holy men they were, but preſently return to their nature, to their prophaneneſs and impurity. Juſt ſo are they that have a fair ſpecious out-ſide, appearing preciſe and godly, to be ſeen and praiſed, or drive an intereſt; they are meer jugglers and ſtage-players, they put a fair vizard over an ugly face, holineſs outwardly, inwardly unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied luſts and perverſe paſſions; <hi>Their lives
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51153:53"/> are nothing but a Comedy, that will have a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. For indeed, this is the cauſe why ſo many are not ſo perfect and holy, as their Chriſtian faith requires and would enable them to be, that they are not ſincere, but want truth in the inward parts. The falſe opinions of the World, are of greater power with them, than the precepts and the examples of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and thoſe moral virtues which nature it ſelf recommends, are commonly made ſin, or ſubſervient to it, by the depraved judgments and cuſtoms of men. We therefore that live in a crooked and perverſe generation, among corrupt and deceived perſons, ought ſeriouſly and often to make this inquiry; whether we our ſelves do know the right way, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we truly follow it? Now that way, which is the way of truth, is one and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unchangeable, and they that will keep it without change; muſt not look to the World, but up to Heaven; muſt not follow the example of men, but muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly follow God, <hi>who alone is the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. WE muſt have a ſpecial care that the ſenſitive part of us have not the principal concern in our good works, and that we be not led by ſenſe in our actions: for ſenſe is the great deceiver, the fountain of error; therefore 'tis ſaid, that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſenſe, is the life of truth. And hence it is that we cannot be confident, ever to have done any thing perfectly good and without defect, becauſe that we bear a part in our beſt works, and as far as they proceed from us, they are ſtain'd with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, although they be done upon Gods account, and by the impulſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of divine Grace. Thus it was ſaid to the Angel or Biſhop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3.2. <hi>I have not found thy works perfect before God:</hi> and thus it might be ſaid to any other. For our Prayers, Faſtings, and Alms, and ſuch like good works, though they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear complete before men, who ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the outſide, yet before God who ſearcheth the heart, they are defective;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51153:54"/> and cannot be acceptable in the leaſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be done with a pure and ſincere intention to pleaſe him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of ten Virgins mentioned in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, five fooliſh were excluded from the wedding; not but that they were Virgins and had lamps, that is, works: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wanted the oil of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and holy affections. This may well be the caſe of every one of us; our works will be dead before God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him, except we breath life into them, by our inward ſanctified ſpirit, and fervent love to God. In outward acts and appearance, all Chriſtians are almoſt alike: but as the hand of a watch is mov'd by the hidden ſprings, and as the colour of the face depends on the ſecret conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body: ſo the good are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from the bad by their inward ſpirit, or <hi>the hidden man of the heart; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within us.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Whence the goodneſs of our works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. AS many that eat much, yet are feeble and infirm and lean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they overcharge their ſtomach, ſo that their nouriſhment is not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted: and as many that eat very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, yet becauſe they digeſt well, are ſtrong and healthy and long-liv'd: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome Chriſtians there are that do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things, and yet themſelves become little better, becauſe they go not the right way to work. They think that by doing much, they muſt become great proficients, though they do it remiſly and incuriouſly: whereas to do our duty every day with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fervency and exactneſs, is the right way to perfection; <hi>a few things well done profit more, than heaps of works done negligently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. For ſo, there are others that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to theſe firſt do but little, and yet increaſe much in the love of God, becauſe they endeavour always to work with greater affection, and a more upright intention: ſo that at the end of every good action, they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51153:55"/> may in ſome manner, uſe that expreſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Croſs, Joh. 19.30. <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> I have in this, as far as was poſſible, done what God required of me, as perfectly as my infirmity would allow, and his free grace enabled me, who gives us to will and to do, and without whom we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They ſo ſpend each day, that at night, they can ſay, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> and they ſo ſpend their whole life that when 'tis ended, they can ſay with an holy and humble confidence, I have now perfected that work which God had appointed me to do. <hi>He that lives ſo, lives like a Chriſtian, and he ſhall not fear in the evil day.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. NOthing will more prevail to make perfect our works as much as is poſſible, than to conſider that God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every where, and that from him and in him, all things have their being, power and motion. This is the moſt preſſing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument why we ſhould always act with the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51153:56"/> greateſt circumſpection, that God ſees the things, that are in ſecret and we can never be hid from his eyes; that in him we live and move and have our being, and that he never forſakes us, till we forſake him to turn our affections upon the creatures. For this is the unhappy effect of our original corruption, that our ſenſes are ſo affected and pleaſed with material things preſent, that our mind is drawn from the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Gods preſence and things as yet inviſible: whereas, if the love of this world did not bear too great a ſway in our heart, we could ſee God in every place; holy affections would always ſee him who is the Author of all holineſs; according to the ſaying of our Bleſſed Saviour, Mat. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. For indeed 'tis not to be expreſt, how ſweet and comfortable is the goodneſs of God which he hath laid up for them that fear him: but laid up it is; none have a ſenſe of it but they that love God; they alone taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is. For 'tis not enough to have a treaſure, we muſt know we have it, before we can be rich, and we muſt know the uſe and the worth of it: Now ſuch a treaſure we have within us, as is of an ineſtimable infinite value, and yet we ſeem not to know it, for we run after motes and ſhadows, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51153:56"/> catch at painted drops that cannot quench our thirſt, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>O ye ſons of men, how long will ye love vanities and ſeek after lies?</hi> Thus we are cheated and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not our own happineſs, <hi>for God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us every moment and we could always enjoy him; we are rich and we know it not.</hi>
                     </p>

We could if we would anticipate the joys of Heaven; we could now have a taſte of the felicity of beatified Saints, but that we indulge Senſe to the prejudice of the Soul; we ſhake off the thoughts and the comforts of Gods preſence, becauſe it puts a reſtraint upon our appetites: And when at any time Spiritual joys are denyed us, we preſently ſeek for Earthly pleaſures; becauſe we open not the eyes of our Faith to ſee God preſent, and we embrace him not with devout affection, and we care not to converſe with him. This is the way to Perfection which God himſelf ſhewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to have always a ſenſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence; Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect:</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> likewiſe made a great uſe of this, to be always mindful that God is with us, Pſal. 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me, becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved.

                     <p n="1">1. WE think it a matter of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to follow the example of thoſe Chriſtian Worthies that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, becauſe we repreſent them to our ſelves, as being now of another nature, freed from the body, inhabitants of the manſions of bliſs, whence anger, luſt, and all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are for ever baniſh'd, and where they enjoy peace and joy and eternal felicities. But if we really deſire to follow their ſteps, and to conform our lives to theirs, then are we to conſider, that as we are ſo were they, mortal men, cumbred with the uneaſie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the fleſh, infected with ſin, tempted by ſinful affections, and expoſed to miſeries and dangers: but that by Faith they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all theſe, <hi>ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought Righteouſneſs, and by fighting obtain'd the Crown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Elias</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James</hi> 5.17.) <hi>was a man ſubject to the like paſſions as we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not rain: and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51153:57"/> it rained not on the Earth by the ſpace of three years and ſix months: and again he prayed, and the Heaven gave rain, and the Earth brought forth her fruit.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of any other Saints, that have done the greateſt wonders; they were like us, made of the ſame clay, and ſubject to the ſame paſſions and temptations, while they were on Earth. They were only above us in this, that with great and aſſiduous pains, they conquered pride and luſt, and eſcaped the ſnares of the Devil, by diligent care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reſolution. Why then do we draw back and make delays? to them that are truly reſolved and willing, 'tis not difficult to become Saints, by the imitation of thoſe that have gone before us; if ſhaking off our ſloth and lazineſs we would ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, we might by the help of Divine Grace arrive to the ſame height of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and bliſs, as they have. <hi>For he hath proceeded far towards holineſs, that ſincerely deſires to be holy.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> How we ſhould in all things aim at Gods Glory.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IT is the precept of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that God ſhould be the end of all our works, that they may be good and acceptable. 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</hi> and again, Col. 3.17. <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> For a good work which is not done upon Gods account, doth become evil, it being the nature of virtue to receive its form from the end, rather than from the act. And if we cleave to the creatures and love them for their own ſake without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, this is that luſt or ſinful love which Saint <hi>John</hi> condemns, 1 Ep. 2.15. <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World;</hi> love them not ſo as to reſt in them. For here we are Pilgrims, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers going home, to our Fathers houſe, to our God: and ſo what creatures we meet in our way, we may uſe them as conveniences to carry us forward, towards him: but we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51153:58"/> may not dwell with them, as if we were at our journeys end. God alone is to be lov'd for himſelf, he alone being infinitely good, and the laſt and beſt end we can propound to our ſelves; in him alone our appetites ſhall reſt ſatisfied, our enjoyment ſhall be ſecure, and our joys undiſturb'd for ever. Whoſoever knows not and purſues not this end, knows not why he lives, nor how to live well: but he that knows it, knows whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to direct his intentions, and whither to tend in all his actions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is granted that ſome natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to walk, to eat, to ſleep, and ſuch like, are of themſelves neither good nor evil: yet all Divines teach that they become ſin, if we do them not to ſome further and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, that is, to live to ſerve God; whoſe glory ſhould be the ultimate deſign of all mens actions, becauſe as he is the beginning, ſo ſhould he be the end of all things. <hi>The light of the Body is the Eye</hi> (ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour, Mat. 6.22.) <hi>if therefore thine Eye be ſingle, thine whole Body ſhall be full of light: but if thine Eye be evil, thine whole Body ſhall be full of darkneſs.</hi> This Eye is the intention of every man in his actions; if it be not good, they become works of darkneſs: and good it cannot be, except it be refer'd to God, the ſupreme goodneſs. <hi>Every good thing comes from God, and whatever returns not to him is evil.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Self-love is the root of all evil.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. AFter our firſt Parent, by preferring himſelf to God, committed that grievous tranſgreſſion, whereby all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind became obnoxious to death; luſt and ignorance: darkneſs and evil propenſities ſeiz'd upon our nature, man forſook God, and turn'd to ſeek himſelf, and having loſt all ſenſe of ſpiritual comfort, ran diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after carnal pleaſures. Hence Self-love the greateſt Enemy to virtue, came to tyrannize over men, who to comply with it, ſeek nothing now but wealth, honours, and ſenſual delights. And now, ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; for all its inſtincts and impulſes have a tendency to ſin, and to ſin only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And yet ſelf-love which ſeeks ſo much our own eaſe and ſatisfaction, is indeed its chiefeſt hinderance; for God having crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us for his glory, and enjoyn'd us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it always; when by ſelf-love we ſeek only our ſelves and our own advantage, we do nothing whereby to obtain Gods favour
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51153:59"/> and eternal life, but rather fall into a wretched ſtate of damnation; <hi>We are debtors, not to the fleſh, to live after the fleſh</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.13.) <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye through the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Now to this mortification, we are ſtrongly oblig'd by Chriſtian Religion; its great deſign is to bring us out of our ſelves to God, that as we yielded our members ſervants to uncleanneſs and to iniquity, even ſo now we ſhould yield them ſervants to righteouſneſs unto holineſs; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.45.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now as Chriſtianity checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains ſelf-love, ſo doth ſelf-love keep men from underſtanding and approving the Chriſtian doctrines; for how can he that ſeeks and loves himſelf, rightly apprehend that whatever the world dotes upon, is meer vanity: that Eſtates and Honours bring great vexations and great ſlavery: that to forgive Enemies and do good to them that hate us, is the part of a noble and generous mind: that 'tis better to deſpiſe than to poſſeſs riches: that 'tis more honourable to be ſubject where God commands, than to bear rule and to domineer: that for a man to reſtrain his appetite and conquer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is more glorious than to win battels and take fenced Cities? Theſe are Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51153:60"/> hard and incredible ſayings to the ſelf-lover, whoſe fondneſs of himſelf ties him faſt to this earth, to whatever can be uſeful and any ways pleaſant to the fleſh: whereas the Children of God live to God, being not led and govern'd by the fleſh, but by the ſpirit: they live in the fleſh, but not after the fleſh; ſome of their actions are natural, whileſt they are in the body, yet they proceed from a ſupernatural principle, and are deſigned to a nobler end; for they continually deny themſelves and mortifie all ſenſual unruly deſires. Self-lovers hold, a great regard ſhould be had to the fleſh; 'tis true, but it muſt be ſuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taught us; to keep it under: otherwiſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath declar'd, that to <hi>be carnally minded is death.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. GOD at firſt placed man in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, but <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom we all ſinned, tranſported us into this world out of Paradiſe, out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of our freedom into ſlavery, out of integrity into corruption, out of our countrey into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51153:60"/> and out of life into death. Thus from truth and perfection we fell into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we are now like unto vanity, nay, <hi>every man is but vanity,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6. Man is vain in his body, which ends in death and corruption; vain in his ſoul, which being inſlav'd to ſin, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to death eternal, and vain in all his outward enjoyments, which all periſh, or muſt be forſaken when he dies. Yet man ſtrangely dotes on this vanity; he paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately runs after theſe tranſitory things which are all cheats and lies, whereby he is drawn into thouſands of pernicious errors, and out of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> into a Helliſh <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now theſe two Cities are built by two ſorts of love; to love God, ſo as to deſpiſe our ſelves, makes the City of God: and to love our ſelves ſo as to deſpiſe God, makes the Devils <hi>Babylon,</hi> the City of this World. The way to this, is broad and ſhort; to that, is ſtreight, difficult and long: becauſe dull and earthly as now we are, we more eaſily fall on the earth and deſcend down to Hell, than we can raiſe up our ſelves and aſcend to Heaven. Let every man therefore examine himſelf and find out what he chiefly loves; for if he loves God, ſo as to deny himſelf, he is doubtleſs a Citizen of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; but if he loves himſelf, ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51153:61"/> his own deſires to God, 'tis plain he belongs to that <hi>Babylon</hi> out of which God hath called his Children. For thus the Scripture cries aloud, <hi>Go ye forth of Babylon, and remove out of the midſt of her:</hi> (Iſa. 48.20. Jer. 50.8.) and again the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 137.8. <hi>O Daughter of Babylon who art to be deſtroyed, happy ſhall he be that taketh and daſheth thy little ones againſt the ſtones.</hi> We come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> when we leave the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſin, forſaking our diſorderly courſe of life: and we daſh the children of <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the ſtone, when our love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> overcomes our ill deſires and ill inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Self-love is the death of the Soul, and the love of God is its life: therefore he doth not truly love himſelf, who by ſelf-love deſtroys himſelf.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. IT may ſeem ſtrange to obſerve, that whereas mens opinions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo various and different, yet all men are agreed in this, that none appears vile to himſelf, none is willing to yield and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51153:61"/> to others, none though never ſo mean but thinks himſelf ſomebody, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be taken notice of; every one ſeeks to be higher than others; every one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to himſelf, and ſevere to others: all men will have their will and their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; all applaud to their own inventions and conceits, and cenſure others; they count their own follies, wiſdome; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great ignorance, there is nothing but what they think to know. They carefully hide their own faults, and pretend to thoſe virtues, they know they have not. And what is moſt of all to be wonder'd at, even good men who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe God, and ſeem to aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his honour and glory: Even they, ſometimes in their beſt actions, by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and natural inſtinct, almoſt unknown to themſelves, ſeek their own comfort and complacency, moſt of all; and the more excellent are their works, the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and undiſcernable is this ſnare, which ſelf-love ſets to the moſt ſpiritual.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What better than to obey God, to read his Sacred Word and preach it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and adminiſter his Holy Sacraments? Yet theſe duties are commonly ſtain'd with ſome ſecret deſire of praiſe: and except the Chriſtian be very watchful over his own heart, he may eaſily loſe his better reward. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51153:62"/> Angels</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>and have not Charity, I am become like ſounding braſs, and a tinkling cymbal.</hi> And though a man ſhould give all his goods to the Poor, and even his Body to be burnt, yet without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without the love of God hath purified his heart, it will profit him nothing. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai,</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ye eat, but ye have not enough: ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink: and he that earns wages, earneth wages to put into a bag with holes:</hi> for thus good works avail nothing, if done out of reſpect to our ſelves, and not to pleaſe God. This being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bent of our corrupt nature, to draw us to our ſelves, we ought carefully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelves, and ſearch the hidden corners of our hearts, that there lurk not in them ſome ill purpoſe of vain-glory or ſelf-intereſt, to mix with our beſt actions, either firſt or laſt. <hi>This is the Rule of a true Chriſtian Life, always to ſeek and love the things of God, and never his own.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. EVery Diſciple of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ought to know thoſe Divine and Human Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he lives, and the which he is oblig'd to obſerve. The Divine are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Ten Commandments, and in the New Teſtament, which contains the precepts of Faith, Hope, and Charity. Faith obligeth all the Faithful to believe the doctrines of Chriſtianity, as they are ſum'd up in our Creed. By Hope we truſt, by the grace of God, and our own ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to obtain and uſe all neceſſary means of Grace, and Eternal Life at laſt; all which, in this aſſurance, we heartily beg in the Lord's Prayer. And Charity requires of us to love God above all things, and our Neighbour as our ſelves. A Chriſtian by theſe three virtues is made a new and holy creature; Faith inlightens and directs his underſtanding: Hope raiſeth him up, and ſets his will at work for God: and to God Charity unites him wholly. It is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to underſtand the neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51153:63"/> and the Lord's Supper, and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which are all Divine Inſtitutions, indiſpenſably neceſſary to all that will be ſaved. <hi>For except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Joh. 3.5. And <hi>Except we eat the fleſh and drink the bloud of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>we have no life in us.</hi> Joh. 6.53. And as for Repentance, it is the only remedy we have for the ſins committed after Baptiſm, that by it we may be made clean again.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Laſtly, there are alſo Human Laws, Enacted by the Church or the State we live in, and them we are alſo to know and to obſerve with meekneſs and humility, and for Conſcience ſake. But no man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is able to keep all theſe Laws which God hath bound upon us; none can obey them without the true light from above en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and guide him, as it is written, Pſal. 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him in thy Law.</hi> For ever ſince ſin came into the World, men without the light of Faith, ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the ſhadow of death, and take an account of good and evil, not by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of truth, but by their luſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved paſſions. We muſt therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg the divine aſſiſtance, that he that commands what he wills, would enable us to do what he hath commanded: heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our blindneſs and impotency; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51153:63"/> ſelf-love and filling our hearts with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout love to him: <hi>for the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is Charity: and he that truly loves God keepe his Commandments without hypocriſie or reſervation.</hi>

OUR Chriſtian hope is not for this World, nor for this preſent time, and we were not created to enjoy that Earthly happineſs which the World only ſeeks: but God made us for that Eternal Bliſs which he hath promiſed, and whoſe excellency we cannot as yet underſtand; <hi>For eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither is it entred into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> We therefore that are called to the poſſeſſion of that Kingdom, which was prepared for us, from the beginning of the World, ought not to govern our ſelves only by human reaſons, and live by natural inſtincts, after the common manner of men, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the ways of Eternity, and the motions of Divine Grace. But happy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51153:64"/> are they that wiſely dive into the depth of things, who live to God and commune with him in their hearts, and ſuffer not their thoughts and affections to range and dwell abroad.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe men live an inward life, they are recollected and dwell at home; always diſpoſed to hear Gods voice within them, and to underſtand his ſecrets. Whereas they live an outward life that are moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with outward things: having fair pretences for their worldly-mindedneſs, being greedy of news, and curious ſights, and ſenſual pleaſures, <hi>walking</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>in the vanity of their minds, alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> For the more a man profits in carnal wiſdom, the more ignorant he becomes in the things of God. <hi>As much as we love the creatures, as much we leſſen our love to the Creator.</hi>

HE is a wiſe man that weighs things juſtly, and then eſteems them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their intrinſick value: for every thing in the world hath a twofold aſpect or a double face, the one natural and real, and the other diſguiſed and fallacious. The firſt is what God judgeth and hath revealed it to be: and the ſecond depends on mens paſſions and falſe opinions. Thus for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; the Dignity of a Biſhop is in effect and according to Gods appointment, a high and Angelic office, of ſuch a weight as ſhould make human ſtrength tremble and ſhrink under it; it is a place of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but alſo it requires the greateſt labour and diligence, to watch for the Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the dignified Prelat, who ſhall give a ſtrict account for them in the day of judgment. But in the Worlds account, a Biſhoprick is only a degree of honour in the Church, which promotes the owner of it to riches and greatneſs and temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Hence it is that they that rightly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51153:65"/> apprehend what the office is, fear and avoid it, and are ſo far from ſeeking, that they refuſe it when offer'd: and it is much to be feared that they follow the worlds judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſeek themſelves, that ſeek it, and make it their aim, and the object of their paſſionate deſires. The ſame may be ſaid of all other dignities and places of truſt, in Church and State; Generally men have a wrong notion of them, and underſtand not their definition: and hence the confuſions and malvorſations that are in the world, that men miſtake things, and hate truth, and will not ſee nor follow divine light, but the darkneſs of their own perverſe hearts.</p>

Such names are commonly uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men as are conſecrated by the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the higheſt virtues of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Saints; as that ſome be called Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons, Monks or Hermits; Some Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates; and all together, Chriſtians: but who is there that duly conſiders the great worth, the ſtrength, and true ſignifications of thoſe names? what virtues, what perpetual care, what duties, they require from ſuch as bear them; the bare Titles, with a vain ſhadow of the things remain, but the reality and ſignificancy of them is vaniſh'd: few men are in truth what they call themſelves, few live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the name of Chriſtian, becauſe few make it their firſt care to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51153:65"/> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This unhappy deceit is alſo an effect of the firſt and worſt of evils, Self-love, the moſt crafty deceiver: hardly found out by the wiſeſt, and ſeldome quite conquer'd by the beſt of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The truth is, that the good and evil things of this preſent life, are ſo mixt and confuſed, that if we take an exact view of the nature of them, we ſhall hardly diſcern the one from the other: for they are all vain and uncertain, and in a moment they come to nothing. Wherefore <hi>David</hi> the man after Gods own heart, paſſing by all temporal things, entertain'd his meditation with things Eternal, <hi>I have conſidered the days of old, and the years of Eternity,</hi> Pſal. 77.5. And <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, the wiſeſt of men, after a long and comprehenſive enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things good and bad, under the Sun, concludes <hi>that all is vanity, vanity of vanities.</hi> Eccleſ. 1.2.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Three things very profitable and neceſſary to every Chriſtian.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat we may be faithful to God as we are oblig'd, we muſt of neceſſity attend to theſe three things. Firſt, to watch and obſerve our ſelves and our actions, at all times, that we turn not aſide out of the right path, into by-ways, difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable, ſeeking for happineſs where it is not, in ſpight of all admonitions. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Chriſtian differs from the brutes, and by Faith from unbelievers; ſo that when he doth any thing raſhly and baſely meerly to ſatisfie his unruly paſſion and his appetite, ſo far he becomes a beaſt and ceaſeth to act as man: and likewiſe, when for vain-glory or ſelf-intereſt he is drawn to action, in this he acts like a Heathen, Faith hath no hand in it. As Arts are attained and perfected by working according to the rules of them: ſo a man becomes Wiſe, Juſt, Sober and Patient, by living according to the preſcript of thoſe Virtues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing recommended is a good and careful uſe of our time, on which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51153:66"/> depends Eternity. Philoſophers would have us not only know things uſeful, but alſo be ſtudious and watchful to take hold of all opportunities of virtue: becauſe time paſſeth away and comes not again, and once loſt is loſt for ever. Time flies away, and the unwiſe man conſiders not, that 'tis never to be recall'd, and that with time he loſeth more than he can think or ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. It may be pleaſant indeed to paſs away the time in ſports and merry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but ſo doth our day go away, and the night comes when no man can work, and we loſe <hi>the acceptable time,</hi> that time that was given us to obtain our Pardon and work out our Salvation in. <hi>We muſt give an account for every idle word, much more for that time which is ſpent idly,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third thing we are carefully to mind, is to make a right uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eſpecially that of the Lord's Supper, which if frequently and devoutly received, would be to us a fountain of grace, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beyond expreſſion: and the more, in that penitence as a <hi>Sacramental</hi> is joyn'd to it, whereby we are humbled and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and our hearts prepar'd to entertain <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom we receive in the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and from whom we receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of love to God, and of meekneſs and charity to men. As a covetous man minds nothing but gain and money, and is always
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51153:67"/> gaſping after it: ſo the devout Chriſtian duly and often receives the Bleſſed Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, always pants and longs after God, and cannot without trouble mind any thing but him. <hi>And it is the principle of a heavenly life, to deſpiſe and forſake all things that have not a relation to God.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. EVery Chriſtian ought ſo to live and die, in ſuch continual regret and mortification, as to make it appear he is a true Penitent, who endeavours to make what ſatisfaction he can for his ſins, and entirely to be cleanſed from the guilt of them. This was the beginning and is the ſum of the Goſpel, Mark 1.4. <hi>John did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the Wilderneſs and Preach the Baptiſm of Repentance, for the Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, the Author and finiſher of our Faith, made it the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his preaching; Verſe 14. <hi>Jeſus came into Galilee Preaching the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and ſaying, the time is fulfilled and the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, repent ye and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51153:67"/> believe the Goſpel:</hi> Or as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, 4.17. <hi>Jeſus began to preach and to ſay, Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi> Repentance was firſt ſent to prepare men duly to entertain the Goſpel, that their Souls might be purified and fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Divine Grace, which never enters wicked hearts, nor abides with them that yield their bodies to be inſtruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But Penitence is a Sacrifice well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, when a man is ſenſible of his ſin, and confeſſeth it with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and with a broken contrite heart begs Pardon of his offended God. For the greateſt evil in ſin, is a contempt of the Divine Majeſty; to live in ſin, is to live in enmity and defiance againſt the Great and Holy God: and to this deſperate impiety men are betrayed by infidelity, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration. For who is there ſo mad and preſumptuous that would dare tranſgreſs the Divine Laws, if he believed and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that God is Almighty and infinitely Good and Glorious, and that an offence againſt ſo high a Majeſty is heinous beyond expreſſion? But to this height of wretched folly, men are carried by original depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that as being ſeiz'd on by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy frenzy, they have a ſecret averſion to God the chiefeſt good, and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in impure ſhadows, in baſe and falſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51153:68"/> enjoyments; and this becauſe they ſee not the truth, or they have not power to follow it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How great and deplorable is this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impotency, we cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, except we ſeriouſly conſider, that the guilt and malignancy of ſin was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, that nothing could make expiation for it, but the bitter death and paſſion of the Bleſſed and only Son of God. This if we believe, and if we are ſenſible of the intolerable burthen of our ſins, we are to paſs our days in ſorrow, and to ſpend our years in mourning, thereby to own our ſelves guilty, and that we have deſerv'd the worſt, the greateſt of evils. <hi>For God readily forgives thoſe ſins which penitence and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeavour to undo.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. WE ſhall never be in a capacity to avoid ſin when the temptation comes, except the ſoul hath conceiv'd a great horror and deteſtation of it: and our penitential exerciſes will ſoon be at an
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51153:68"/> end, except we hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, ſo as never to be ſatiated without it. Therefore when we humble and puniſh our ſelves, and when we make our confeſſion to God or his miniſters, we ſhould, beſides contrition and a reſolution in general to ſin no more, deſign the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of ſome one particular ſin, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void and prevent the occaſions of that one ſin which is moſt dangerous and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Hence will accrue to us a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our penitence, and we ſhall the better bring forth fruits worthy of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch as theſe; fear to offend and diſpleaſe God any ways, a great dread of his juſt judgment, to check and reprove our ſelves with ſhame and confuſion of face, to be ready to make all ſatisfaction and amends poſſible for paſt offences, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and mortify all ſinful appetites, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to avoid all the ways and allurements to ſin, to humble our ſelves and willingly to bear contempt, frequently to examine our conſcience and ſearch the ſecrets of our hearts; to root out, as much as is poſſible, all vicious deſires and inclinations, and to ſet in their ſtead all virtuous and holy affections.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They that make this their ſerious and conſtant employment have their own ſins before their eyes, but have no eyes for the ſins of others; they grieve for their own
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51153:69"/> offences, and puniſh their own follies, but they paſs by or excuſe the faults of others; they ſee their own danger, and are always afraid of falling, and always watchful not to fall. For our neceſſary converſe with the World, our ill cuſtoms, and our dwelling with baits and temptations, expoſeth us to ſin, and yet takes the ſenſe of it from us: eſpecially our evil inclinations, which being born with us, have a ſtrong party in our hearts, and begin by times to deprave or harden Conſcience, that it ſhall hardly have any feeling of ſins daily committed. <hi>And then this is the unhappineſs of contracting ill habits, that the oftner we act by them, the more we confirm them, and the leſs we obſerve our faults and errors.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXIX.</hi> Remedies againſt ordinary failings, and greater ſins.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. TO fall into thoſe ſins which ſome call Venial, or ſins of daily incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is hardly to be avoided; and yet even thoſe ſins cannot be ſaid to be little that are committed againſt a great God, and for which we muſt ſuffer Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51153:69"/> if we our ſelves were to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for them. But though there is pardon for thoſe unavoidable errors which without a ſpecial grace, we cannot but commit at ſome time: yet ought we to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with all our power daily to leſſen the number of them, and to prevent them by acts of contrary virtues, one by one. To that end, we ſhould be as careful as men are in contagious times, who not only avoid infected perſons, but alſo all that hath toucht and been about them: ſo ſhould we in the caſe of thoſe ſins that are counted light, avoid and ſtop all the ways and avenues that lead to them, <hi>Leſt we falling frequently, at laſt fall into the pit of death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every moment almoſt we have ſome temptation to vain talk or vain inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to anger or unſeemly jeſting, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or impatience, to idle thoughts and diſtraction, or to ſuch like ſins, which are the more difficult to be avoided, that being mixt with all our worldly affairs, they are hardly to be diſcern'd. Therefore we muſt at leaſt ſecure this, that however our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtands affected to any of thoſe leſſer ſins, yet our hearts may not entertain any love for them, leſt our own affections hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, carefully to watch and ſtrive againſt them. Without this, our after-Repentance and our Sacramental vow will ſignifie little
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51153:70"/> to obtain remiſſion of them, or victory againſt them. I know that 'tis ſaid of theſe failings, that <hi>the juſt man falls ſeven times a day:</hi> but yet certain it is, that the juſt man endeavours againſt it, and that he never falls, but by frailty or by ſudden ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Likewiſe for vices or greater ſins, to conquer them you muſt ſtifle them in the birth, ſuppreſs the firſt motion to them, and meet the temptation with an act of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue contrary to it. As for example, if you be abuſed and provok'd, refrain the firſt ſtirring of Anger, and then buſie your mind with ſome act of Patience and Humility, conſidering that you ſuffer that, and leſs than that you deſerve, praying for him that doth you wrong, and reſolving to do him any kindneſs you can. For thus we beſt avoid evil by ſtudying to do that which is good, and the laſt is as much our duty as the firſt: and that ſervant deſerves no great reward who doth not ſtrike and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile his maſter, if he doth not withal, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerve and obey him. In this many deceive themſelves, who think to have made ſure work of their Salvation, becauſe they have not been wicked, when yet they have neglected poſitive duties, and have not done thoſe good works which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd from them. <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do good, both are equally commanded, not to tranſgreſs by omiſſion no more than commiſſion.</hi>

THough the ſame inſtitutes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection be delivered to all, and all are to walk by the ſame rule, as has been ſhew'd before, Chap. 7. Yet it cannot be denyed, but that Clergy-mens obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a ſtrict devout life, are much inforced upon them, by their particular calling: For they are not only oblig'd to be holy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo <hi>by their life and doctrine to ſet forth the glory of God, and ſet forward the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men.</hi> In order to which, they muſt be very careful ſo to follow after vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and all things that are honeſt and of good report, ſo to live, and ſo to converſe with men, that their words and actions may ſpeak them, and others may acknowledge them, to be indeed the ſons of God, and miniſters of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and to this the leaſt neglect and remiſsneſs will be very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, becauſe they are obſerv'd by all,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51153:71"/> and men generally are apt to judge and to follow the worſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They muſt remember that as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are but Stewards and have nothing of their own, and muſt uſe the World as not poſſeſſing it, and as being ready to part with it: ſo they more eſpecially are to count nothing their own, and that little they have as well as themſelves, muſt be ſubſervient to the deſign of their function. They muſt remember that they are not only as others oblig'd to live by the Goſpel-Rules, but that beſides, they have devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to the ſervice of the Church, and have vow'd obedience to its conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo far are barr'd from their own will, which muſt comply with that order and commiſſion they have taken. And moſt of all let them remember that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, whoſe ſervant they are, humbled himſelf, came in the form of a ſervant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of no reputation, became poor for us, though he were Lord of all, and became obedient to the death, <hi>Profeſſing he was not come do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. What will it avail to read the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and examples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Saints, if we follow them not? thoſe things were written for our learning and are ſet before us for our imitation. It hath been ſaid by ſome, that no Chriſtian comes to Heaven,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51153:71"/> that is not a Martyr; we muſt all be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for it, and indeed that mortification and ſelf-denyal, which all Chriſtians, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſpiritual guides are oblig'd to uſe, is a kind of Martyrdom without bloud; is the Crucifixion of our deſires and appetites. Too many, 'tis to be confeſt, live irregularly in their calling, Chriſtian and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, unmindful of the obligations of that bleſſed order they are entred in; their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion deprives them of the ſenſe and the comforts of Piety, ſo that they are fain to ſeek for pleaſure abroad, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, becauſe they find it not in their own heart, and the doing of their duty. Many they are that go a ſtray, and judge that to be beſt which is done by the moſt, and follow the broad way in a crowd: but few they are that with ſincerity follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the narrow way of the Croſs. <hi>It is a great folly to be careleſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in that way, wherein the beſt and wiſeſt men have trembled, and walking with the greateſt warineſs, have found it very hard to go right.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLI.</hi> That Prayer is neceſſary to all, and what diſpoſitions are requiſite to make it acceptable.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. SUch is the neceſſity of Prayer that 'tis become an approved ſaying, that without it none can be ſaved. For who can obey the divine call, <hi>leave all and follow me,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of grace? and who can obtain it without begging for it? therefore we are taught by Holy Scripture, Luke 18.1. 1 Theſ. 5.17. <hi>That we ſhould always pray and not faint,</hi> becauſe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and in all things we want the help and aſſiſtance of God. Now he may be ſaid to pray always, who every day hath his ſet hours of Prayer, which as they return, are obſerv'd duly. He Prays always, who in all things walks uprightly, and with an holy intention deſigns Gods glory; for Prayer is the elevation of the Soul to God. He Prays always, who in his heart preſerves an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual devotion, and always deſires to Pray; that very deſire is a good Prayer. Laſtly,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51153:72"/> he prays always who always lives well; a good life is a continual Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. No man ever became wicked, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or heretick, who did not firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and caſt off this Holy Duty. Prayer is the pipe or conduit which brings Divine Grace into our Souls; take it away, and Grace hath no paſſage, and the Soul is parch'd and wither'd, and at laſt by degrees muſt die. Neither is it enough to mumble over a few oriſons, and recite them only with the voice, as too many do, without attention, without reverence, and without devout affections. Of them God complains by his Prophet and his Son. Iſa. 29.13. Mat. 15.8. <hi>This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> On them ſhall come the imprecation of the Pſalmiſt, 109.6. <hi>Let his Prayer be turned into ſin.</hi> Their words are lies that work wickedneſs, and yet ſing with Holy <hi>David, That they hate ſin and love the Law of God:</hi> and they whoſe God is their belly, and yet profeſs with him, Pſal. 102.4. <hi>My heart is ſmitten and withered like graſs, ſo that I forget to eat my bread:</hi> And they that ſpend their time in mirth and laughter, and yet ſay with that penitent Prophet, Pſal. 42.3. <hi>My tears have been my meat day and night:</hi> And they that neither regard nor obey divine precepts, and yet pronounce with <hi>David, Curſed are they that depart from thy Commandments and are far
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51153:73"/> from thy Law.</hi> Such Prayers are meer mockeries, they are an abomination to God, and they provoke his wrath, rather than appeaſe him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. No man deſerves the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, except at leaſt twice a day, morning and evening, he lift up his Soul to God in devout and fervent Prayer: ſpending as much time therein for the comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his immortal ſoul, as he commonly doth for the feeding of his mortal body. And let none intermit or leſſen the duty, becauſe he finds himſelf dry and dull, and wants that holy reliſh and livelineſs of holy affection, which ſometimes he hath felt; for true devotion doth not conſiſt in tears and tender paſſions, and overflowings of ſenſible joys, which may be felt by ſuch as pray to images and falſe deities: but true devotion conſiſts in a ready and well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will to ſerve and obey God, and abſtain from all ſin. <hi>God is known and worſhipt by Faith and not by Senſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. I do not find fault with thoſe rules and directions how to Pray, which are given by pious men; they may be uſeful, but alone they are not ſufficient: For Prayer is not to be learn'd as a Trade, by imitation of the work that lies before us. No, the Art of it is in the Heart, in a careful watch over it, and over our ſenſes. For how can he have the Spirit of Prayer, whoſe Spirit
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51153:73"/> is let looſe to vanity? How can he approach God, duly to deal with him concerning the Salvation of his Soul, whoſe Soul is all day taken up with the World, with idle talk and idle buſineſs? It is a great error to think that of a ſudden a man of clay can raiſe himſelf up to Heaven, can do that work which is moſt Spiritual and moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, without ſerious attention and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nay with the obſtacles and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a whole days employment about earthly things. No, Prayer doth require a pure and well compoſed heart, free from the Images of Worldly concerns, fitted and deſirous to entertain it ſelf with God: and the beſt preparation to this Bleſſed Duty, is a good and upright life, with a meek and peaceable converſation. He that would daily pray better, ſhould ſo value Heaven and Heavenly things, that therein may be his comfort, and he may be dead to the World. <hi>That Prayer which is accompanied with true Faith and humility is ever accepted.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLII.</hi> Why many are not profited by Prayer, and that we ſhould ſtudy to Pray well and frequently.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. MAny receive little or no advantage from their Prayers and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they entertain and cheriſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections contrary to what they Pray and Meditate; and they make reſervations, and do not wholly devote and offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, to comply in all things with his good pleaſure. They deſire that God would teach them to know and to fulfil his will, and yet they ceaſe not in many things to neglect and to oppoſe it: having as it were, a double heart, one they offer to God when they Pray, the other they reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cannot ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>With my whole heart I have ſought thee.</hi> Others acted by curioſity and the ſpirit of Pride, ſeek after high Speculations and abſtruſe learning, which ſignifies little or nothing to the knowing themſelves, and the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſinful paſſions: and if at any time their Spirit be ſoftned and they find
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51153:74"/> ſome delight in ſighs and tears; yet ſoon after that delight is gone, they remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of their Humiliation, they return to their former ways, and ſtill remain tangled in their follies and their vicious habits.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence it is that thoſe ſudden changes or converſions are not durable, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſudden and ſtrong commotions; for the violence of that paſſion, which carryed away the Heart, coming to abate, it returns to its former and more pleaſing affections, and ſoon repents of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Some ſeek themſelves more than God, in their Prayers, becauſe therein they find ſome refreſhments and Spiritual delights: and ſome ſeek after abſtractions and extatick raptures, to be therein raiſed up to Heaven and know great myſteries: but all theſe will ſignifie nothing without Contrition and Humility. The great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Prayer is to find the World loſe its power and its repute in our Hearts, and to find our wills more reſign'd to God, to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and to obedience. <hi>He Prays beſt that deſires to know nothing and to obtain nothing, but</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and him crucified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a common error to think that meditation is a thing exceeding difficult, when indeed every man is daily occupied about it, for to meditate is to revolve and view things in our minds; and that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51153:75"/> do, vain and worldly, and often ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things. Why cannot we then as well conſider the myſteries of Faith and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of our Salvation? Sure we could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, if we would ſeriouſly endeavour to expel the world out of our hearts, then there would be room for the things of God, and we could fix our thoughts upon them. Want of this makes us unfit for Prayer, and unwilling to be crucified to the World, and to bear the Croſs and Reproach of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> We pretend indeed that our occupations are neceſſary, and perhaps good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, ſo that we have a good warrant to diſpenſe with prayer and meditation: but there is a time for all things, and however the buſineſs of the Soul is our chiefeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and 'tis a great folly to neglect it upon any account.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The body without nouriſhment ſoon decays into weakneſs and death, ſo doth the Soul without its proper food, which is prayer: and it wants it the more frequently, in that it hath many more and greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities than the body hath. For heat and cold, hunger, thirſt and ſickneſs, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever afflicts the body, doth alſo vex and prey upon the Soul which is compatible with it: and beſides that, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh it ſelf, are all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Soul, and daily conſpire its ruin, and it hath no ſtrength nor defence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51153:75"/> nor comfort, but from prayer only. We ought therefore always to pray, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to call upon God, in the inner-man, in the inward receſſes of our Souls, which are the Temple of God, wherein he is pleaſed to dwell. We need not always words in our private Cloſets, God ſees our thoughts, and hears our ſecret deſires. Yet they may uſe books to good purpoſe, that are not uſed to mental prayer. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the publick Devotions of the Church ought to be ſaid and ſung aloud, and to be conſtant and unalterable. That all the Faithful may agree in them, and edifie one another, by joyning their voices as well as minds, to ſend up their praiſes and petitions to God: <hi>Yet ſtill the heart is the houſe of prayer, and the Kingdom of God is within us.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLIII.</hi> How to Pray, and avoid diſtractions, and fix the intention.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat our Prayer may be truly good and acceptable, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ask all things out of love to God. For though a thing be good in it ſelf, yet
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51153:76"/> the ſureſt and better way it is to deſire and demand it upon Gods account, becauſe it will pleaſe him, that Self-love may not be the principle and purpoſe of our petitions. The ground on which our prayer muſt reſt, is a lively Faith, and a ſenſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, whom we muſt approach with an humble ſimplicity; as much as may be like an Infant brought to his Mothers breaſt. He is not altogether intent to his devotion, that conſiders himſelf praying; for whileſt he reflects on his prayer, his mind is diverted from God to whom he prays, and ſometimes he is diſtracted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to avoid diſtraction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, ſimplicity is beſt in prayer; to think of nothing but God, to look to none but him whom we worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For his mind ſhall hardly be drawn to other objects that ſhall conſider God as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; the immenſity of divine perfections will abſorb his thoughts; they ſhall ſail in that boundleſs Ocean, and find no limits, and all other things but God will be out of ſight. But the perfection of this, is reſerv'd for a better State; here we muſt expect diſtractions, and if we duly ſtrive againſt them, they ſhall not make our prayers to be unprofitable: For God will hear them and aſſiſt us, whileſt we contend with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. Yet we ſhall ſooner be freed from ill and idle thoughts, by ſlighting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51153:76"/> them, and taking off our minds from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to them, than by fencing and fighting againſt them: for ſometimes whileſt we ſtand to confute them, they make the deeper impreſſions on perplext and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearts. <hi>A Prayer dry, without reliſh and comfort, is the more acceptable to God, in that it is unpleaſing to Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. As Travellers always bear in mind the place whither they would go, ſo they that pray ſhould always be mindful of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Prayer, which is to be united to God, as much as is poſſible in this life; to have our will made conform unto his, in all things; to aim at any thing but this, is to loſe our labour. Now prayer may be ſaid to be of two ſorts, the one common and ordinary, perform'd by our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and diligent application, together with the aſſiſtance of Grace; <hi>For no man can ſay that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the Lord, but by the Spirit:</hi> the other extraordinary and infuſed, more ſecret and myſterious, <hi>with ſighs unutterable.</hi> We may beg the gift of both, for God is free and very gracious: yet we muſt apply our ſelves to that which is more common, and wherein we have a part to act; which conſiſteth in a bleſſed diſpoſition to lift up our Soul to God, and entertain holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pour out our hearts before him. This God is ready to grant to ſuch as truſt in him, and are of a meek and humble
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51153:77"/> Spirit; for <hi>every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</hi> Therefore ought we to begin our prayers with an humble acknowledgement of our being nothing but miſery and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and wretched ſinfulneſs: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, we ſhould take care to fix our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, that God may be glorified, and his will may be done, and we may cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fulfill it. <hi>Now this is the Will of God, even your Sanctification.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> The great advantages of Prayer.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WHat is written concerning Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may very well be ſaid of Prayer. Wiſd. 7. <hi>I prefer'd her before Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Thrones, and eſteemed Riches nothing in compariſon of her; I loved her above health and beauty, and choſe to have her inſtead of light, for the light that cometh from her never goeth out: All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable riches in her hand: and I rejoyced in them all, becauſe ſhe goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and I knew not that ſhe was the mother of them; ſhe is a Treaſure unto men, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51153:77"/> never faileth, which they that uſe become the friends of God.</hi> For indeed, Prayer is a fountain of grace, a parent and nurſe to all virtues; it increaſeth the joy of them that rejoyce, and giveth comfort to ſad hearts; it is the light of the underſtanding, and the food of the Soul, and the procurer of all happineſs. Prayer appeaſeth Gods Wrath, obtains pardon for our faults, overcomes our ſins, delivers us from dangers, inkindles the holy fire of divine love in our hearts, and is an act of all virtues together. It is an Act of Faith, for thereby we declare our belief of God's being preſent, ready to hear our prayers, able and willing to grant our devout petitions. Hope alſo is quickned and confirm'd, for by Prayer we relie upon God, and profeſs our truſt in his infinite mercy. And Charity likewiſe is increaſt; whileſt we conſider and call upon the divine incomprehenſible goodneſs, we are inflam'd with the love of it, and other things loſe their eſteem with us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Devotion teacheth us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, and to weigh things wiſely in the balance of the Sanctuary. Prayer is an Act of Courage and Chriſtian Fortitude; whileſt we reſolve to ſerve God, and be faithful to him, whatever we ſuffer for it. It is alſo an Act of Temperance; for the devout heart having a foretaſt of Heavenly joys, deſpiſeth the World, and all its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51153:78"/> Prayer gives a clearer ſight of things Eternal, and manifeſts the ſecrets of Divine Wiſdom. By it the Soul approaching God, is penetrated by his light, and ſo learns the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. By it we exerciſe our Charity whileſt we pray for others, our fear of God, whileſt we humble our ſelves at his feet, and our love and conſtancy to our Dear Redeemer, whileſt we profeſs we would die, rather than diſpleaſe or deny him. <hi>And ſo Prayer is an abſtract of many Virtues, and he that Prays much, is much a Chriſtian.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. ALL men generally commend and deſire truth, but few know where it dwells: and ſhould they know it, they would love and purſue nothing elſe. But certain it is that truth is not in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51153:80"/> things Earthly and periſhing, becauſe they ſoon decay into nothing, whereas truth alters not, but abides for ever. We muſt ſeek it therefore in things immortal, which have a conſtant being and remain to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Truth is to be found in Virtue, which is the Image or Tranſcript of it, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not according to the circumſtances of Human Life; but continues the ſame in all conditions, always above vanity, always abſolute Regent over all Paſſions and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual deſires.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That man is acquainted with truth, whoſe mind and affections are guided by reaſon, and his reaſon by revelation, by Faith, by the Spirit of God: Whereas he that is a Caitif to his Luſts, and a Slave to his Paſſions, is altogether vain, being toſſed by continual troubles and contrary pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations: ſometimes fears and ſometimes deſires, ſometimes anxious thoughts or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps vain joys; now grief for loſſes, by and by greedy purſuits after new acquiſts; grievous vexation now for being injur'd, worſe ſoon after in ſeeking for revenge. Theſe unruly paſſions are the ſprings of all our miſeries, and the off-ſpring of vanity and voluptuouſneſs, the great diſturbers of our Peace and tormentors of our unhappy Souls. Vanity begets impatient deſires of being honour'd and eſteem'd, high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of our ſelves, contempt of others, and a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51153:80"/> ſecret averſion to Truth. Voluptuouſneſs inclines men to eaſe and ſports, to the Luſts of the Palat and the lower belly, to all things that can pleaſe the body and gratifie a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual mind. Hence looſeneſs and diſſolution, and worldly mindedneſs; whileſt the Soul eſtranged from God purſues after outward comforts, ſeeks after Vain-glory, idle talk and idle paſtimes, and is altogether taken up with toys and vanities.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe are the things that make the Chriſtian Laws, the Goſpel-Rules unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the World, to all carnal men; that the Goſpel injoyns nothing more than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and corrupt nature inclines them to Pride; the Goſpel requires broken peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hearts and reformation, and men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor nothing more. So that without Faith 'tis impoſſible to find out and imbrace thoſe great and ſaving truths; <hi>Faith is our victory over the World.</hi> The Bleſſed Son of God to atteſt the truth of this his Heavenly Doctrine, <hi>that we muſt take off our affections from the World,</hi> confirm'd it by his Life and Example as well as by Miracles. For whereas men labour to be rich, he choſe to be poor; whereas they aſpire after domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and high dignities, he fled and hid himſelf when the <hi>Jews</hi> would have made him King; men think it moſt grievous to bear injuries, and he patiently ſuffered the greateſt; they will not abide to be ill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51153:81"/> of, and he was moſt falſely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly condemn'd. His ſufferings and his converſation, were our leſſon and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and we never ſin but when we ſeek thoſe things he deſpiſed, and flee from that which he willingly indur'd. <hi>He doubtleſs is much abuſed and deceiv'd that thinks felicity conſiſts in what</hi> Chriſt <hi>taught us to deſpiſe.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. YOU ſhall hardly find a perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, becauſe they commonly that have overcome the greater ſins, neglect the leſſer; they will not watch and offer violence to themſelves for ſmall matters (as they count it) and by degrees they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the brink of the Precipice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance afterwards get a grievous fall. Heinous and crying ſins affect us with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at firſt ſight: but we eaſily admit of ordinary failings. None will be ſo deſperate as to caſt away all his hopes and ſpend his whole ſtock of Grace at a time: as none would be ſo mad as to ſend his whole Eſtate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51153:81"/> going in one day. No, men uſe to ſay, this is no great coſt, this will hardly at all ſink the bag: or in another caſe, 'tis but one glaſs, one bit more, that can do me no hurt: but by little and little they at laſt ſpend all, and come to poverty, or elſe they ſurfeit and are drunk: and likewiſe the ſame fate in Spiritual things attends the ſame neglect and unwarineſs. Occaſions of heroick virtue and doing God extraordinary ſervice, do ſeldome occur: but almoſt every moment we have an opportunity of doing ſome good; therefore we ſhould deſpiſe nothing, becauſe almoſt every thing puts it in our power to exerciſe ſome virtue and do ſomething to pleaſe God. We ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve every motion of our heart, and mind to rectifie the leaſt irregularity of our affections, and take all occaſions to mortifie pernicious ſelf-will and ſelf-love. <hi>No man of a ſudden grows wicked, but he that deſpiſeth ſmall things, ſhall fall by little and little.</hi> Eccl. 19.1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every human comfort, though never ſo innocent, yet in ſome manner excludes the divine: but he that can paſs by all outward things, and entertain himſelf with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> chuſe him for his onely portion, who alone is all-ſufficient, his joys ſhall be ſolid and laſting. As Philoſophers ſay that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you take one body, another ſucceeds in its place, leſt there ſhould be a <hi>vacuum</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51153:82"/> in nature: So, and much more certain it is, that when the ſoul empties it ſelf of all affection to creatures, it is ſoon repleniſh'd with God, and all divine conſolations. But alaſs, 'tis to be confeſt that we having uſed our ſelves from our infancy to delight in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, which are preſent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſenſe: we afterwards grow very unapt to entertain and pleaſe our ſelves with objects Spiritual and Supernatural, which are far out of ſight and can be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended but by Faith only. Hence it is that we lie groveling on the ground, and attend to nothing but the dictates of fleſh and bloud, and remain inconſtant and unable to raiſe up our ſelves above our depreſſed nature: until having ſhook off the vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of tranſitory things, <hi>We turn our ſelves to God and ſettle our reſt in him, who is our peace and our joy, and the end and center of all things.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THE Life of every Chriſtian ſhould be a perpetual Self-crucifixion, yet the deliciouſneſs of the Croſs is underſtood but of very few, ſuch as have been intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with it. They only know that have tryed, how much pleaſure follows contrition and ſelf-abnegation, inſomuch that they find it moſt bitter when they any ways depart from their humble penitent temper, to return to the life of ſenſe. The World indeed counts them unhappy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe commonly they are poor, afflicted and deſpiſed: but they rejoyce in their tribulations, and find themſelves happy, being well pleaſed with what happens to them, becauſe they deſire moſt of all, that God's will may be done in all things. Is it his pleaſure to make Poverty their lot? they freely accept of it. Will he have them afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? they ſubmit. Are they to be ſcorn'd and diſgrac'd? they are not unwillign; come what will they like it; therefore they are moſt happy that have all things at will. As for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51153:83"/> the wicked that ſeek after the pleaſures of ſin, though they have what they wiſh, and appear proſperous to envy and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet they really are unhappy, becauſe they wiſh what they ſhould not, what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and diſhoneſt, and will bring ſorrow at laſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Croſs is the Center of our holy Religion, the moſt myſterious and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine of it, both for belief and practice; he that ſeeks not for the Croſs when he becomes a Chriſtian, underſtands not as yet what the Goſpel deſigns. <hi>Chriſt</hi> at firſt conceal'd many things from his Diſciples, becauſe they could not hear them: yet weak and ignorant as they were, he acquainted them with the ſcandal of his Croſs and ignominious paſſion. St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe to the new Converts would give milk and not meat, yet notwithſtanding would preach to them <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Crucified, to the <hi>Jews</hi> an offence, and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fooliſhneſs; nay, he himſelf with all his learning, profeſt that he did not care to know any thing, ſave <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and him crucified. And the Primitive Church, for ſome time conceal'd many things from the Catechumens, and yet never the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nay every Chriſtian is, and was of old ſigned in his forehead with the ſign of the Croſs, in token he ſhould not be aſhamed of <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified: <hi>And God forbid we ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51153:83"/> glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is made unto us, wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption.</hi>

Hence the abſolute neceſſity of patience and ſelf-denyal, ſo that whoever doth not renounce himſelf cannot be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciple. <hi>If any one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will come after me, let him take up his Croſs and follow me: and if he doth not hate</hi> (that is, be ready to forſake) <hi>father and mother, wife and children, and even his own life, he cannot be my diſciple: for whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</hi> Mat. 16.25. He doth not only ſay that a Chriſtian muſt deny pride, intemperance, luxury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, pomps and riches, and ſuch things that are without us, but himſelf; he muſt deny himſelf, that is, his natural deſires and affections, his own will, the ſuggeſtions of his own carnal mind. Theſe he muſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and mortifie, and overcome; <hi>Crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts;</hi> and make his life an image and repreſentation of the Crucifixion of <hi>Chriſt.

                     <p n="1">1. IN the Spiritual building Self-denyal is the firſt Stone; for what will raptures and high-flown thoughts ſignifie, what will avail communions and familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances with God, and what the preciſeſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if in all theſe we ſeek our ſelves, aim at our own glory, and puft up with Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pride do deſpiſe others? He is wiſer than all the Philoſophers, who in his heart owns himſelf ſimple and ignorant; he is higher than the greateſt Monarchs, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes himſelf the meaneſt of men. Our virtue, perfection and ſafety conſiſt not in lofty expreſſions, nor yet in things won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and extraordinary; but in the Croſs, in bearing reproaches, in ſelf-abjection: and no man can obtain here true vertue and ſanctification, and hereafter glory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, renouncing his own deſires, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf to ſuffer, and be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified. Yet we muſt obſerve that as <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> did bear the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and yet not die with him:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51153:84"/> ſo many bear a heavy Croſs without true mortification; in what they ſuffer they have ſome other deſign, than to glorifie God and to ſubmit to his bleſſed will.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Who would think that ſelf-love ſhould be found in the Croſs, which it abhors ſo much? Yet ſo it is; not a few there are, who willingly or otherways, can indure much, that they may boaſt of it, that they may be ſeen and praiſed by men. Such men indeed do bear the Croſs, but they will not be crucified with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they deny and afflict themſelves, but becauſe they will not truſt God for their reward, they have none at all, they loſe their labour and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Many others there be that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that their affairs and neceſſary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments abroad, keep them from mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is good, by depriving them of their inward peace: but the things that diſturb the tranquillity of the Soul, are from within, becauſe we will not break with our ſelves, becauſe we are too ſenſual and too much ſeek our eaſe and advantage. From hence proceeds that inward and vexatious war betwixt the Spirit and the Fleſh, which can never ceaſe till Reaſon and Religion reign in us, and the inferior appetites be brought to obedience and perfect ſubjection, to the higher rational faculties.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If a man had a friend ſo dear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that he could not eat, nor reſt, nor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51153:85"/> live one day without him, and a faithful and creditable Monitor ſhould tell him that his pretended friend is falſe and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and deſigns to ruin and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him; would not his love preſently ceaſe, and be turned to hatred and thoughts of revenge? Chriſtian Reader, ſuch a friend is our fleſh; we gratifie and indulge it, and uſe it with the greateſt kindneſs: and at the ſame time, under pretence of friendſhip it deceives us, and deſigns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of immortal life, and to bring to Eternal death. Yet this falſe friend ſleeps in our boſome; we are not to war with ſtrangers and with far diſtant Enemies: but with one that dwells with us at home, and accompanies us wherever we go, and always lies in wait to take advantage of us, and do us miſchief. <hi>Let a man forſake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and come out of himſelf, and then he will find no obſtacles in his way to Heaven.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How we muſt fight our corrupt nature and depraved affections.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WE muſt be very careful to obſerve what is the object of our love or fear, and what of our joy or ſorrow; for theſe four affections have the abſolute power of our heart: and God by them is the maſter of it, when we love and fear nothing but him and for him, and when he is the cauſe and the meaſure of our joy or ſorrow. When theſe motions of our mind are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly and tend where they ſhould not, we become unruly like beaſts: but when they are ordered and directed right, then they are highly ſerviceable and they make us holy and happy like Angels. For in this conſiſteth the perfection and happineſs of man, to have his affections and deſires guided by truth and reaſon; for then his love and his joys become inſtruments of bliſs and virtue: whereas the ſame affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when guided by corrupt nature alone, become pernicious and vexatious, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into wild luſts, monſters which we muſt always fight, and with our utmoſt ſtrength indeavor to conquer.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51153:86"/>2. But to this purpoſe, it will not ſuffice that we in general indeavour to reform and keep under our appetites and unruly paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for corrupt nature is well enough pleaſed with all the apparel and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mortification, ſelf-denyal, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over ſinful paſſions; and Philoſophers grow in love with the fair Ideas of virtue, in this pompous attire: and many in this have deceiv'd themſelves, and boaſted of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over their evil inclinations, becauſe they find not in themſelves an averſion to vertue and good deſires. But when it comes to tryal indeed, and they are no longer to fight with the notion of ſin in general, but with a preſent urging luſt, with a preſſing uneaſineſs and neceſſity, with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to anger or to impatience: then it appears how vain, how weak and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, were their great thoughts and fine reſolutions. Better it is therefore carefully attend to every particular occaſion of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing our ſelves and reſtraining our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved appetites, and to do it ſeriouſly and to purpoſe; for ſo by degrees we ſhall rectifie and amend every defect, and bring all our paſſions and deſires under the power of right reaſon, or Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But this is not to be done without an ever-watching diligence, an unwearied pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, a great application, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering courage and labour: that by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51153:86"/> a perpetual violence to our evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities, as they ſhew themſelves, we may go to the root of them; and quite pull them up. For now in our ſtate of depravation, every holy affection and the lifting up of our Soul to God, is violent, being againſt nature, againſt the bent of our ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites: ſo that we muſt renew our indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and add new vigor to them every moment, elſe we fall down, and nature eaſily prevails, and we ſoon return to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As weeds in gardens may be pull'd up, and yet not hindred from growing again of themſelves: ſo by care and by keeping a ſtrict hand over our vicious affections, we may ſo keep them under, that we ſhall think they are quite deſtroy'd: but do what we can, the ground of our corrupt nature, will always be apt to produce ill weeds, and ſin of it ſelf will be growing again; ſo that we muſt never give over fighting, never ceaſe to mortifie and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves whilſt we live. And yet, if by God's aſſiſtance we can once do ſome one noble act of Chriſtian vertue, report one noted victory over our ſelves: that alone may be ſufficient to aſſert and enlarge our liberty, and obtain us grace, whereby we ſhall afterwards eaſily overcome all our averſions to vertue. Some holy men have been ſo encouraged and ſtrengthned by one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51153:87"/> great and difficult triumph, that afterwards without fear and with little trouble or danger, they have overcome all enemies and oppoſitions. <hi>So great a thing it is to fight with fortitude, and maintain once a noble contention, till we have conquer'd.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the right uſe and moderation of our outward Senſes.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. BEcauſe the eyes commonly are an inlet to ſin, we ought to turn them from tempting objects with the ſame care and quickneſs as a man would remove out of a houſe infected with the Plague. Now human eyes wherewith created things are beheld, may be ſaid to be of three ſorts. The firſt altogether Senſual or natural, when viewing the outward beauty of an object, we are pleaſed with it, and conſider no farther. The ſecond may be call'd Rational or Philoſophical, when we making reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the ſymmetry and other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things viſible, are moved thereby to ſearch and to know the nature of them. And the third we may ſay, are Chriſtian or Religious, when by the beholding of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51153:87"/> creatures, we raiſe up our Souls to the love and contemplation of the Creator. With theſe eyes pious Souls viewing the beauties of the univerſe are led to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of its glorious maker, who is the fountain of all beauty and perfection, as the author of all ſubſiſtence and being.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now as the life of the body depends upon its union with the Soul, ſo doth in ſome manner the life of our ſenſes depend on the preſence of their proper objects; as things viſible to the eyes, audible voices to the ears. The pleaſure which thoſe ſenſes receive from a beautiful ſight, or a ſweet harmony, may be called their life: and their death or mortification, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this, is their being deprived of thoſe objects, whereon they act with delight; which deprivation is very uſeful, if not altogether requiſite, to arrive to a ſtate of vertue and ſanctification. For nothing is more deſtructive of a Chriſtian Life, than a life of ſenſe: the imagination being as it were in the middle betwixt the ſoul and the ſenſes, when theſe work upon her, as they are moved by outward objects, ſhe likewiſe works upon the ſoul, and draws it to aſſent to the voluptuouſneſs of lower fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: and this is not to be avoided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we bar our ſenſes, by a ſtrict reſtraint, from thoſe things which affect them with ſinful delights.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51153:88"/>3. In this conſiſts the death of ſenſe, which is to be conſidered as twofold; the firſt Natural, when there is ſuch a real ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration betwixt ſenſe and its object, that they cannot poſſibly meet: The ſecond Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, when ſenſe perceives but enjoys not its object, being reſtrain'd from the pleaſure of it. The firſt, ſome judge to be leſs difficult and more ſafe: it being eaſier to avoid all occaſions of ſinful pleaſure, than to keep a due moderation when we ingage in them: but in this diſcretion and due meaſures are to be obſerv'd. The ſecond is accordingly thought to be more dangerous, becauſe ſenſual pleaſures are very inticing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating, and are known by ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to have a great prevalency over the Soul and nobler affections.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And then farther, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that we ſuckt the poyſon of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs together with our milk; from our very infancy we learn'd to indulge ſenſe: and though we have often experimented that its delights and ſatisfactions are ſhort, and vain, and unſatisfying, and withal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and highly afflictive to the Soul: yet ſtill we have the ſame notions of them, they ſtick cloſe to our mind: and thoſe pleaſing though falſe apprehenſions which firſt entred our hearts, will not be rectified, nor be gone, till we have a long time, uſed ſerious reflections and conſiderations, till
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51153:88"/> by many acts of ſelf-denyal and contrary virtue we have imprinted in our minds the true principles of Chriſtianity. <hi>God is a Spirit, and a ſpiritual life is the way to him; to chaſtize and reſtrain the fancy, to keep under the body, and be guided by divine precepts, is the way to ſpiritualize our ſelves and to come to God.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. IT is no difficult matter for a man who truly loves and fears God, and ſtudies to pleaſe him, to deſpiſe and forſake all worldly pleaſures, pomps and vanities: but to abſtain from all food is not to be done, for by it our bodies are reſcued from death, and the neceſſity of it returns upon us dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But becauſe there is ſomething of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſatisfying of this need, there is danger alſo leſt luxury mingle with it, and pleaſure which may follow after, be the leading cauſe to our refection: therefore though we cannot wholly forbear eating and drinking, yet we muſt take great heed of the voluptuouſneſs of it, that neceſſity be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51153:89"/> not the pretence, and pleaſure the deſign of eating. Nature is ſatisfied with a little, but greedineſs or daintineſs are always craving: and ſometimes we know not whether want or wantonneſs call for food, and we are glad and willing to miſtake, that we may have an occaſion to gratifie the unruly appetite. In theſe we muſt daily watch our ſelves, becauſe theſe temptations do daily return: and we muſt diet our ſelves with ſuch moderation, that we may nouriſh our bodies, and not feed our luſts. <hi>Plain, abſtemious and frugal food is the health of Soul and Body: and he that pampers not his fleſh, by the quality or quantity of his meat and drink, may eaſily maſter all carnal deſires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. To ſeek after feaſts and dainties, and to make them the matter of our diſcourſe and our meditation, is the part of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, of one whoſe God is his belly, and who minds earthly things: but a Chriſtian ſhould be indeed, and alſo live as a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; preſſing neceſſity ſhould bring him to his table, and thither he ſhould come as if bread and water were his onely allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that whatever is ſuperadded may reliſh better, and he may be more content and thankful, and alſo moderate. This we might eaſily do, if we would duly conſider how abſtemious primitive Chriſtians were, how much our bleſſed Lord faſted, and how for us he taſted vinegar and gall. This if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51153:89"/> we would often call to mind, and ſeriouſly ſet our ſelves to the imitation of their Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed examples, our converſation would be in Heaven, and our thoughts would be far enough from dwelling in caves and kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins. As for the other fleſhly luſts which alſo war againſt the Soul; all occaſions to them are to be avoided, and idleneſs alſo; a ſtrict watch over our ſenſes muſt be kept; the rules of a ſevere modeſty muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and eſpecially we muſt ſhun all frequent and familiar converſe with the other Sex: for this without our knowledge and againſt our will, kindles a dangerous and ſecret fire.

THE Evils of the tongue are paſt number, therefore ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.19. <hi>In the multitude of words there wanteth not ſin, but he that reſtraineth his lips is wiſe.</hi> Indeed talkativeneſs is a fountain and a torrent of iniquity. It is a mark of ignorance, it betrays much folly, and is a great enemy to ſerious thoughts and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Mens words for the moſt part proceed from ſomething of Pride, for they commonly ſpeak to teach others and to ſhew their own wiſdom and great parts. Every one thinks he knows much, and to make it appear and be thought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body he commonly outs with more than he knows. As bad air drawn in, doth in time affect, infect the body: ſo doth the breath of many words much prejudice the Soul. It diſſolves the ſpirit, and breeds quarrels and contentions, and utters lies and detractions, and brings forth looſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly jeſting and jeering, and evils of all ſorts. In vain doth he indeavour to be devout and to have peace within, who doth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51153:90"/> not refrain his tongue and ſet a watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his lips. In vain doth he endeavour to amend himſelf, that cenſures and ſpeaks ill of others. This is a ſnare wherein many are caught, to be indulgent to themſelves and ſevere to others, to boaſt and magnifie what is theirs, and ſlight as much what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to others. Few there are that wholly renounce to this vice; few that lead ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt a life, as not willingly to tax others corruptions. The propenſity to this ſin is ſo great, that many counted good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have overcome divers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and mortified their other luſts: yet fall here, and cannot bridle their unruly tongue, the laſt gin the Devil ſets to catch Souls: and it hath been obſerv'd by men of great piety and great experience, that a great talker was never very good, or never perſever'd to be ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Silence therefore which ſequeſters us from mens vain converſe, that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our ſelves with God; ſilence which ſanctifies all our perſecutions, ſorrows and infirmities, muſt needs be highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to every one that makes a right uſe of it. For when in any caſe we ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and yet hold our tongues, we then offer to God our Souls and Bodies, goods and good names, as a ſacrifice: we follow the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who opened not his mouth, but was led as a lamb to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51153:91"/> and we poſſeſs our Souls with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and free our ſelves from clamours and perturbations. Sometimes indeed a juſt defence of our ſelves may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: but we muſt be very cautious that we exceed not the due bounds of Chriſtian meekneſs and humility. And yet this can happen but ſeldome; as when we are called to anſwer, by the Magiſtrate; when the ſlander would make us uncapable of exerciſing, or uſeleſs in the exerciſe of a publick office; or when it would be others detriment; in theſe caſes we may ſpeak with truth and meekneſs: in others we had beſt hold our tongue. And that it may be to purpoſe, we muſt alſo refrain and quell our inward paſſions: that the tumult within make not the outward peace inſignificant. <hi>I kept ſilence even from good words,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: if from good words ſometimes we muſt refrain, much more always from vain and ill language. <hi>He is a wiſe man that can hold his tongue, for 'tis leſs difficult to kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="1">1. VIrtue alone is the true and laſting pleaſure of rational creatures; other things are pleaſant but in appearance, and for a ſhort uncertain time, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens various opinions: for worldly pleaſures proceed not from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is conſtant and common to all, but from corrupt appetites which always do change and differ. As a ſick Palat cannot rightly diſcern of the reliſh of meats, no more can a vicious man feel and underſtand what is true pleaſure, which proceeds only from virtue, to which he is too much a ſtranger. Senſible delights indeed by natures inſtinct, are pleaſing to all, and few juſtly know how to uſe, and when to refuſe them. But man was created to a nobler end, than only to gratifie ſenſe: he was made for the ſight and the fruition of God, the laſt and ſovereign good. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we cannot contemplate truth and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, but by the help of thoſe Ideas and repreſentations which we have from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51153:92"/> ſenſe, and our rational faculties cannot well diſcharge their function, when the organs of the body are diſcompoſed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt have ſuch care of our bodies, as may render them fit inſtruments for our ſouls, and preſerve them ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But we ſin grievouſly and pervert the order which God and nature have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, if we make bodily pleaſure the end of our natural actions: whereas we ſhould deſign them, and make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to thoſe nobler offices for which we were created after God's Image. I confeſs we cannot long ſubſiſt without ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, corporal or ſpiritual: and we cannot divide our Souls equally betwixt both: but then this obligeth us to aſpire the more after heavenly joys, and to delight our ſelves ſo much the more in God, in the ſenſe of his favour and the hope of his glory, that we may deſpiſe and diſreliſh the pleaſures of ſenſe and vanity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But let it be obſerv'd alſo, that ſome love vertue more for its glory, than its goodneſs ſake; they aſpire after God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a thing high and tranſcendent; they live a ſtrict and ſevere life, becauſe it denotes a brave and generous ſpirit; they preſerve inward peace, becauſe it is pleaſant; they inquire after the way to Heaven, and to that purpoſe conſult many Books, that they may enlarge their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

All this theſe men do for to pleaſe and magnifie themſelves; when they think moſt of all to ſerve God, they only ſerve to their own pride; and when at laſt they ſhall expect great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they ſhall find their hands empty of good works; and their hearts full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Self-love. God is therefore to be ſought with humility, with ſingleneſs of heart and a ſincere Spirit; he is to be lov'd above all things, and for his own ſake. <hi>This life is the valley of the ſhadow of death, a ſtate of warfare, a place of perpetual labour: reſt and peace, and joys eternal are reſerv'd for a better life.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THat we generally live by opinion, is known and acknowledg'd, but how great is the force and the prevalency of it, is not perhaps ſo well underſtood. Opinion in many caſes and after a ſtrange way, doth exerciſe a great power, or rather tyranny

                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51153:94"/> over men. It makes them as it pleaſeth healthy or ſickly, poor or rich, miſerable or happy: for no man is either of theſe but as he thinks himſelf. Opinion brings joy or ſorrow, not ſo much according to the reality of good and evil, as according to the fancy: for experience tells us that what we wiſh'd or fear'd was nothing ſo pleaſant or grievous as we imagined. More than that, Opinion not only gives a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being to things that are future: but alſo unites together things that are far diſtant, and makes us feel in one moment the goods or evils of many years to come, and which perhaps ſhall never be. Opinion alone for the moſt part, brings credit and praiſe to men and their actions: and if all the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the riches of the world were united together, they could not content one ſingle man, except his opinion were alſo ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Hamans</hi> wealth was exceeding great, and he was firſt in the Court of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and yet he thought himſelf the unhappieſt of men, becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> a poor Captive, would not ſtand up and honour him, when he came into the Palace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another great miſchief of opinion is this, that it lengthens the preſent time, and makes its duration in ſome manner inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; as if our life and worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to have no end: and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe it contracts Eternity, and leſſens to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51153:94"/> almoſt nothing thoſe incomprehenſible, amazing, everlaſting ages that follow this uncertain life. Men alſo commonly take an account of moral good and evil by the meaſures of opinion: and whilſt they ſeek to avoid one extreme, they too often fall into another. As ſome from a dull lazy life, become too reſtleſs and buſie; from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality many fall to covetouſneſs; and from ſuperſtition to profaneneſs and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. The laſt cheat of Opinion I ſhall now reckon, is that it generally makes us judge and eſteem our ſelves, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own ſenſe and conſciouſneſs, but according to the vain thoughts and talk of other men. We defer ſo much, not only to our own, but alſo to others opinions, that except they will count us happy, we cannot be ſo. We are not contented to live to our ſelves, but we muſt alſo entertain a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome imaginary life to pleaſe we know not whom; people that perhaps know us not, and to be ſure, care not for us; whoſe judgment we our ſelves ſlight in other things. Thus neglecting that true and real life which we our ſelves enjoy, we make it our care and indeavour to preſerve and adorn that life which depends on others, and hath no ſubſiſtence but in ours, and other mens fancy: and ſo far doth this deluſion prevail that what we our ſelves feel and know, is nothing to us, except others be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51153:95"/> acquainted with it. From all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous errors and deceptions of opinion, we cannot be freed by the power of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon, without the ſupernatural light of the Divine Grace enlighten our minds: <hi>For our opinions become true or falſe according as is the light that guides us.</hi>

ALL knowledge is good that agrees with truth, but he that would work out his ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, had need learn firſt what concerns it, becauſe our time is ſhort, and great learning in other things is great trouble and great vanity. It is the ſaying of S. <hi>James,</hi> that <hi>to him that knows to do good and doth it not, to him it is ſin:</hi> 4.17. As if he ſhould ſay that it is ill to eat and not digeſt. For as indigeſted meat nouriſheth not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurts: ſo much knowledge not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and converted to uſe by the fire of holy charity, fills men with pride and ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51153:95"/> peccant humors, and at laſt ends in death. Theſe two things men are to care for whilſt they are in this World, firſt to keep the life of the Soul, which conſiſts in the grace and the favour of God: and ſecondly to preſerve their temporal life: but for the firſt, many are unconcern'd; let what will become of the Soul, their ſtudy and all their labour is that it may be well with the body. And ſo they run blindfold after their luſts and ſenſual enjoyments: being wiſe indeed, as children of this world, but having none of that wiſdom which makes men wiſe unto Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They that ſpeak doubtfully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully are odious to men (ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi>) much more are they odious to God, that live ſo; whoſe very life is a lie, as well as their words. They pretend to know God and his holy ways, and vainly boaſt to follow them, when yet they go quite contrary; they reprove and tutor others, not themſelves; they cunningly diſſemble their vices, and make a ſhew of thoſe virtues they are ſtrangers to. But they cannot deceive God who ſearcheth the heart, and their hypocriſie cannot be hid from him, who ſeeth the things that are in ſecret, and at the laſt day will bring all to light. And O that men would view their ſtains and imperfections, in the great and eternal light of that terrible day, for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51153:96"/> then they could eaſily diſcern, and as eaſily cleanſe and amend them. We have but theſe two ways to take notice of our defects and deformities, either in the light of our own reaſon, comparing them to our ſelves: or in the light of Divine Revelation, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them forth before the bright and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence of the moſt holy God. The firſt is like a winter days light, dim and cold: but the ſecond is the ſun-ſhine of a ſummer-day, ſo clear as to make the leaſt mote viſible, and hot enough to burn and conſume all our droſs. <hi>But to ſee this ſaving divine light, a man muſt come out of himſelf and go to God, in whom alone is truth and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and out of whom all things are meer impoſtures and follies.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. ALL our actions contrary to God's will, and in compliance to our own, are the fewel for that fire which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable. For ſelf-will may be ſaid to be the maker of Hell and the leader to it, the Author of all the evils which eternally
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51153:96"/> afflict all the wicked that rebell'd againſt God. As likewiſe even in time, the leſs a man follows his own will, the farther he is from being miſerable, the nearer he comes to true happineſs. And he that hath wholly renounc'd to his own deſires and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hath the greateſt aſſurance that can be had here, of being eternally happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. How this is to be done, our Bleſſed Saviour taught us when he ſaid <hi>follow me:</hi> for he himſelf, as he teſtified came not into the world to do his own will, but the will of the Father that ſent him: ſo that to follow him, we muſt follow his obedience, forſake our own will to comply with his; to follow him we muſt take up and bear his yoke and his Croſs, which to the fleſh is indeed hard and afflictive, but to the Spirit is comfortable and delicious.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. TO be much alone in quiet ſilence, and there to examine and inſtruct ones ſelf, is the way to have our ſenſes and our thoughts well compos'd. Therefore a wiſe man hates much talk and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, keeps his eyes cloſe to curioſities, and his ears to flying reports, and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not himſelf with too much of the world: remembring the ſaying of wiſe <hi>Ben-Sirach,</hi> that he ſhall become wiſe that hath little buſineſs, (<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 38.24.) God is but one, and he can beſt commune with God that dwells by himſelf. And if a wiſe man be called forth to ſome outward
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51153:97"/> imployment, by neceſſity or by Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet his thoughts will always tend homeward, to dwell in peace with the inner man, in an humble and quiet heart, wherein there is always a ſenſe of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence. Whereas he that is too intent and buſie about the circumference of unſettled creatures, ſhall not be able to come to his proper reſt and center, which is God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To the ignorant fooliſh World it is very grievous to be alone and converſe with themſelves but for a few hours: they are afraid of themſelves, and they make it their chiefeſt care to be ingag'd abroad, and to avoid their own company. They ſpend much of their time upon the neceſſities of this preſent life, and yet what remains of it, lies upon them like a heavy burthen, and they are glad to find out occaſions to throw it away. They dread to look within, and to hear the voice of their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and finding nothing in themſelves but fearful apprehenſions, vexation and tediouſneſs of ſpirit, they range abroad, and go for comfort to other creatures. Serious thoughts are a terror to them, and conſideration is as bad as death: becauſe their Soul lies naked and deformed, loaded with ſins and miſeries, and they have juſt cauſe to avoid the ſight of ſuch a Spectacle. No wonder therefore, if but a

                     <p n="1">1. HOW apt Riches are to corrupt a good Life, how pernicious is the love of them, our Bleſſed Saviour taught his Diſciples, when he affirm'd with an aſſeveration, as being a thing of great moment, and much to be noted, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that a Rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.23.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51153:98"/> And that this terrible ſentence might make the deeper impreſſion upon their hearts, he exemplifies Rich mens danger by this Parable; <hi>It is eaſier for a Camet to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> The Door of the Heavenly Kingdom is narrow and can give no entrance to ſuch as are loaded and cumbred with fardels of Wealth. We ſhould therefore love and deſire Riches, as a ſick man doth a bitter Potion; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to recover health but it is unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and if he could be well without it, he would let it alone, and however he takes no more than needs muſt: ſo ſhould every Chriſtian be affected to the things of the World; they are the ſtaff of our Pilgrimage, and our neceſſities require the uſe of them: but yet they are vexatious and dangerous too, and therefore we may wiſh we could live without them, and we muſt take no more of them than is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſupply our wants; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Tim. 6.6. <hi>Godlineſs with Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is great gain.</hi> And 'twas the Counſel of a good man, <hi>Fear not my Son, though we are made Poor, for thou haſt much wealth if thou fear God, and depart from all Sin.</hi> Tob. 4.21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is truly Rich, that is Rich to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and hath a Treaſure of Good Works in ſtore. But they can hardly be Innocent,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51153:99"/> that will be Rich in the World; for the love of Riches is the Root of all Evil. Men care not what ſins they commit ſo they may get Wealth, and when they have it, its great uſe is to purchaſe therewith the ſatisfaction of their Luſts; the Luſt of the Eyes, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life, which are the Idols of the World. But as ſome that play with pibbles and pins, are very intent to their game, when yet they value not the inſtruments of it: ſo ſhould we care for our neceſſities, and yet not ſet our hearts upon thoſe things that ſupply them; we may uſe money to that end, but we may not inſlave our affections to it, except we will become moſt baſe and miſerable. We ſee when Nuts are thrown among Children, they will greedily ſcrape and fight for them, and Men will ſtand unconcern'd and deſpiſe ſuch traſh: ſo ſhould we, as many as fear God and are true Chriſtians; when Riches and Honours are to be got, and men that know and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better, will croud and ſtrive and ſweat for them, let us laugh and pitty their folly, thoſe things are but Nuts, not worth our ſtooping; if any fall into our boſome, we may break it and eat it, but 'tis below us to ſcramble for them; all Worldly things are meer deceit and vanity. When the Son of God became Man, he would have no Riches, to teach us how much we
<pb n="39f" facs="tcp:51153:99"/> ſhould deſpiſe them. The Children of this World like not of this, they rather deſpiſe Chriſt and his Divine Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love and eſteem Mammon: but the Children of light gather their Treaſure in Heaven, where neither moth nor ruſt corrupteth, and where thieves cannot break through nor ſteal. <hi>He is Rich enough in this World, that wants not Daily Bread.</hi>

FEW underſtand or conſider how to uſe their Eſtates aright; that they are the proviſion for this preſent ſhort Life which a good man obtains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wrong to others; and own with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pride or Covetouſneſs, and preſerves without anxious fears, and diſtributes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regret or nigardlineſs, where Charity and Neceſſity call. Now the meaſures of Neceſſity are to be taken from the Man's ſtate and condition. For ſome by birth or by place, are Noble and dignified Perſons, who in reſpect of their ranks, which ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51153:100"/> be Honourably maintain'd, have greater wants than their inferiors, who may have ſufficient with a leſſer Portion. Yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we are all but Stewards of what we poſſeſs, and we ſhould all ſtudy Alms and Moderation, that God our great Land-lord may find us faithful. For he is the true owner of all that we have, we are but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants under him, who ſhould uſe all for his glory, and in the midſt of our plenty be voluntarily Poor as to our ſelves: <hi>And when Riches increaſe ſhould not be proud nor ſet our heart upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nature hath hid Gold and Silver in the bowels of the Earth, and the Covetous that ſeeks for thoſe beloved mettals, is bowed down and ſtoops to the ground, and can hardly raiſe up himſelf to look to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but the wiſer Chriſtian looks upon all inferior things as periſhing and ſoon ended, and therefore ſets his affections on the Riches above, which are true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. There he ſeeks for Honour, where 'tis given to none that are unworthy of it; he expects that Kingdom which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, expells all fears and all dangers; all his poſſeſſions here, he offers to God with himſelf: being ready freely to be in want, if Providence ſhall pleaſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now by theſe tokens it will appear that our hearts are free from Covetouſneſs and the love of Mammon: If we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51153:100"/> that they are a cumbrance and a heavy burthen; if we ſlight them, and are very well pleaſed to be without them; if when we have them we are not puſt up with Pride and Vain-Glory; and if we look upon fine Houſes, and rich Furnitures and ſuch things, as the vain Monuments of Mens Vanities, and the great obſtacles to their Salvation. Happy are they that are free from the love and deſire of thoſe things, they ſhall live in peace and ſafety, and trouble and fear ſhall not be able to take hold of them. As 'tis better to ſleep well in a mean narrow Couch, than to be ſick and reſtleſs in a ſtately Bed: ſo is it much better to be content and quiet with a little, than to have much, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with much of vexation. <hi>He that is content, is Rich and Happy.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. OUR Bleſſed Saviour hath aſſign'd the Kingdom of Heaven to them that are Poor in Spirit, Mat. 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

I am Rich, praiſed be God, and have more than ſufficient for my needs, and more than I deſire: and my affections cleave not to what I have; I have the uſe but not the trouble of it, for I can freely part with it, without pain or regret. I am truly inricht with the poſſeſſion of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth which is from above, in it all things are contain'd, and it is all-ſufficient of it ſelf; for in it I perceive that I have right to nothing, that I am nothing, and that I can do nothing of my ſelf. That Bleſſed Truth tells me that I muſt not place my Contentment in Earthly Tranſitory things, which like ſhadows will ſoon paſs away and would deceive me: and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can happen to me, but by that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence of my Heavenly Father, which brought me naked from my Mothers Womb, and naked will bring me to the Duſt again. <hi>This is the Wiſdom of the Juſt, infuſed from above: theirs only is the Kingdom of Heaven, for they only deſpiſe this Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Would to God Chriſtians were thus

For indeed you ſhall hardly find one man that can poſſeſs the things of this World, as not being his own, and that can be Rich and Content under Poverty. Few they are that come to this Perfection, becauſe men love the Vanities and Conveniencies of this Life, which are purchaſt with Riches: and few they are that regard the Precepts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 6. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and its Righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> And, <hi>Be Content with your Food and Raiment and be not ſolicitous for it, for your Heavenly Father knows that you want thoſe things.</hi> Why then don't we believe our loving Saviour, and truſt the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Heavenly Father? becauſe we ſuffer our deſires to run over the World, and we conſider not that the way to Heaven is ſtreight and narrow: and becauſe we give ear to our Luſts, and will not hearken to the Truth, nor be guided by it.

                     <p n="1">1. SUch Riches as are not imploy'd in a moderate ſupply of our neceſſities, according to our quality, may not be kept nigardly, nor ſpent profuſely upon Pride or Luxury: but they belong to the Poor, they muſt be ſpent in Good Works and Pious uſes, for the advancement of God's Glory, and the benefit of mens Souls and Bodies; and he much indangers his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that doth not diſpoſe of them on this wiſe. Mony kept in bags is but dreſs, its worth conſiſts in the uſe of it: and if it ſerves not for the relief of the neceſſitous,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51153:102"/> and the gathering Treaſures in Heaven, then it becomes miſchievous, and the guilt of it doth exceed its weight. Lands, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and other moveables are generally called Goods, not that they make a man good of themſelves, but becauſe the owner may do good with them, and thereby make himſelf better and happier: as it is written, Pſal. 112.9. <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the Poor, his Righteouſneſs endureth for ever.</hi> For, <hi>The ranſom of a Man's Life are his Riches,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) Prov. 13.8. And <hi>as water will quench a flaming fire, ſo Alms make an attonement for Sin</hi> (ſaith the wiſe <hi>Ben-Sirach</hi>) Ecclus. 3.30. Nothing ſuits better with our Chriſtian Profeſſion than to pitty and help the afflicted, remembring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the infirmities of our common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the afflictions of others: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more unnatural and Anti-Chriſtian, than to refuſe comfort and aſſiſtance to others, or even to our ſelves in our wants, that we may increaſe our Wealth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich our heirs: but the worſt of all is, to loſe our ſhare of the joys of Heaven, and damn our Immortal Souls, that they that ſhall ſeize upon our Riches, may have wherewith to be Prodigal and Vicious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſhall not undertake to determine, when and how far every one that can, ſhould deprive himſelf, that he may ſpare for Charity, this can have no other meaſures,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51153:103"/> than ſuch as Piety and Chriſtian Prudence ſhall aſſign. Only I ſay that God knows our hearts and abilities, and we muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves to him. And I hear our Bleſſed Saviour commanding to all without diſtinction, Luke 11.41. <hi>Give Alms of ſuch things as you have.</hi> And the great Preacher of Repentance injoyn'd the multitudes that asked him what they ſhould do, Luke 3.11. <hi>He that hath two Coats let him impart to him that hath none: and he that hath meat let him do likewiſe.</hi> I hear the Pſalmiſt declaring that <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the Poor, for the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.</hi> Pſal. 41.1. And the Prophet inſtructing all Penitents on this wiſe, <hi>Deal thy Bread to the Hungry, and bring the Poor that are caſt out, to thy Houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked cover him, and hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh.</hi> Iſa. 58.7. I hear Religious <hi>Tobit</hi> giving this Leſſon to his Son, <hi>Give Alms of thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and when thou giveſt Alms, let not thy hand be Envious, neither turn thy face from any Poor, and the Face of God ſhall not be turned away from thee. If thou haſt abundance give Alms accordingly: If thou have but little, be not afraid to give according to that little; for thou layeſt up a good Treaſure for thy ſelf againſt the day of Neceſſity; becauſe that Alms do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from Death, and ſuffer not to come into darkneſs.</hi> Tob. 4.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. What can be ſaid more than all this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51153:103"/> to prove Alms-giving to be much a Duty, and moſt advantagious? But yet let us hear alſo what the Beloved Apoſtle ſaith in this matter, 1 John 3.17. <hi>Whoſo hath this Worlds good, and ſeeth his Brother hath need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of Compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in Him?</hi> If not the love of God, then ſelf-love, that is, luſt and ſin, dwell and reign in him: and his Portion in the next world ſhall be with the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. who was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day, and yet would not give <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſo much as the crums that fell from his Table. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Covetous cryeth, or ere long will cry againſt him, why doſt thou put by that poor hungry man? thou art his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, in that thou art able and doſt not feed him; that Bread which thou canſt ſpare is his: thoſe garments which fill up thy Trunks, belong to the Naked: and the money hoarded in thy Coffers, is the juſt right of the Neceſſitous. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the great Judgment, will condemn to Hell ſuch mercileſs wretches as thou art: <hi>Go ye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>into Everlaſting Fire, for I was hungry, and you fed me not: I was thirſty and you gave me no drink: naked and ye clothed me not.</hi> Mat. 25.42. He doth not mention ſuch preſſing extream neceſſities, as muſt be now ſupplied, and could be relieved by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51153:104"/> none elſe; ſuch occur but ſeldome, not once perhaps in a mans life. Therefore we muſt not ſtay for ſuch Extremities to be Charitable: but we muſt ſpare as much as we can, and what we can, we muſt give in Good Works, for Charity is the band of perfectneſs, and ſhall cover a multitude of ſins. Neither yet muſt we as ſome do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay our Charity till we can keep no longer what we have. <hi>That which Death makes us give, if we could have given it before, will be nothing ſo acceptable, as what we our ſelves freely diſtribute, when we have power to keep it.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of Patience in Bearing and Forbearing.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. OF all the Virtues wherein Chriſtians muſt exerciſe themſelves, that they may come to Life Eternal, none is more excellent and none more uſeful than Patience. By it we imitate the forbearance and long-ſuffering of God, who provoked by ſo much wickedneſs and diſobedience, yet doth good to all men, and makes his Sun to riſe upon the Juſt and the Unjuſt. Patience governs the mind and preſerves it in Peace and an even Temper; it breaks
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51153:104"/> Anger, and bridles the Tongue, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies Pride and a high Spirit; it ends Quarrels, and entertains Friendſhip, and it conquers the World; it tames the Fleſh, overcomes Temptations, bears nobly and meekly reproaches and perſecutions, and it perfects and crowns the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. If all men were Patient, the evils of mankind would be nothing ſo great nor ſo numerous as they are: and we ſhould be happy with abundance of love and quietneſs. By Patience a wiſe and good man may be diſtinguiſh'd from a vicious fool. It is ſo diffuſive a vertue, that it is neceſſary to all other vertues, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all vices: and God inſtructs and proves the beſt of his Children by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their Patience. Nothing can hinder but that injurious Words and Actions ſhall affect and ſtir up our minds: and nothing but Patience can make us maſters of our ſelves, can pacifie our tumultuous Spirits, and reſtrain us from miſchief and revenge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Philoſophers themſelves have extold very high the Praiſes of this excellent vertue: and they made it the chiefeſt mark and oſtentation of their own wiſdome. But as they know not the true God, from whom proceeds, and to whom tends all true vertue: ſo their Patience was falſe as well as their wiſdom. But we that live in the School of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are taught by him, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51153:105"/> through many Tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God: and this is the only true wiſdom, to know <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and him crucified, and to love, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bear his Croſs. For a Chriſtian muſt be made conformable to his Crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, our life muſt be the Image of his Death: So that he is no Chriſtian that hates and refuſeth the Croſs, and will not ſuffer. Let none of us ſinful men that own God for Father expect to be without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement in this World, for his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beloved Son was not, though he was without ſin: even the <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to ſuffer that he might enter into his Glory. <hi>Every one in this life is viſited with pains and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, either for his converſion or for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection: but the moſt afflicted endures nothing that can be compar'd to the ſhame and the Croſs of</hi> Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Adverſities are occaſions of Vertue and muſt be Patiently indur'd,</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THis our preſent Life is the way through which we muſt go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and in it we find all the properties that belong to a way: ſometimes it is even, ſometimes rough; ſometimes it is pleaſant, ſometimes full of briers, rocks and precipices; in ſome places it is crowded with company, in ſome it is deſart and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary: and here and there you meet with wild beaſts and robbers; rain and fair weather daily ſucceed each to other, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles and difficulties frequently occur, and even in Grace and Religion the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſaying doth take place, <hi>Omnia fieri ſecundum litem,</hi> that there is contention and oppoſition in all things. We ſee it in Vertue which is acquired by fighting, by reſiſting Temptations: and mans ſtrength and fortitude would be unknown and of no uſe, ſhould he not meet with afflictions, and uneaſie tryals. I know this is not the ſenſe of the world, the fools party is very
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51153:106"/> numerous, and they are all for eaſe and for pleaſure. If you take a proſperous one out of the herd, one that is every where flatter'd and loudly applauded, one whoſe Table abounds with coſtly dainties, whoſe Eſtate is great and daily increaſing, whoſe Houſes are ſtately and richly furniſh'd, whoſe worldly proſperity is complete, and is equally admired and envied: If you come to ſuch a one, and indeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him with the ſtrongeſt reaſons and ſweeteſt eloquence, that his is but a painted happineſs, a more empty vanity, grounded upon vulgar opinions and errors, and that croſſes and afflictions are much more eligible and beneficial, and lead to Bliſs and Eternal Glory: you ſhall certainly ſpeak that which is truth, but as certainly ſpend your breath in vain.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſo it is; God viſits his Children with ſorrows and calamities that by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they may learn, how inconſiderable, how weak and periſhing and how falſe are all thoſe Enjoyments wherein the World place their felicity: and contrariwiſe, how advantageous are thoſe afflictive diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which men count the worſt of evils, and how ſweet and laſting thoſe comforts they deſpiſe. It is therefore the part of a wiſe man, in all events, in all croſſes, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerfully to comply with Divine Providence: and to look beyond the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51153:106"/> cloud and there fix his heart, where true joys are to be found. Let the wicked rage and perſecute the righteous as far as they can, let what calamities will happen: yet ſtill it will remain true what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>No Evil ſhall happen to the Juſt.</hi> Prov. 12.21. Proſperity ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave, and Adverſity ſhall not caſt him down: but he will ſay with the Prophet, Jerem. 10.19. <hi>Truly this is my grief and I muſt bear it;</hi> 'Tis beſt it ſhould be as it is, and I would have it ſo, for it is God's will. <hi>All Creatures whether they will or no, muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to God: but ſome like children chearfully obey and do what is juſt, and ſome like ſlaves bear puniſhment and ſuffer what is juſt, but all men are bound by the Divine Laws, either to pair or obedience.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. MAny bear patiently imaginary croſſes which never happen, they fancy to themſelves great evils to come, and they go through them with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and upon this account reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51153:107"/> patient, and mean while the little vexations that occur daily diſſolve them into peeviſhneſs and fretful anger, and they cannot bear the leaſt croſs or contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it is preſent. But we muſt beware of this illuſion, and conſider that great occaſions of patience happen but ſeldome, whereas the leſſer are very frequent; almoſt every hour we may have opportunities of exerciſing this vertue, either by bearing with others, or by checking and correcting our ſelves. And we ſhould always bear more chearfully that croſs which is of God's ſending, than that which is our own choiſe: for that which God appoints is always beſt, whereas we are ignorant and often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. As a ſick man therefore would rejoyce to have met with a skilful Phyſician, able and willing to cure his otherwiſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtemper, and would drink and ſuffer any thing from him: <hi>So ſhould we gladly and thankfully take the bitter Cup from Gods hand, whatever it be filled withal, and though malice and envy reach it out to us; for thereby God reſtores our dying Souls to health, and fits us for an endleſs life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This holy confidence and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will take the ſting out of all afflictions; when we are thus diſpoſed and thus willing to receive them, they ſhall not be half ſo grievous, and they ſhall be much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. Neither ſhall the oppoſitions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51153:107"/> of the fleſh, nor the reluctancies of nature be an hindrance to this, as long as we pray and fight againſt them, and thoſe acts of our minds, which being free are capable of rewards or puniſhments, ſide with God againſt ſenſual affections. But indeed if the man murmurs, and tranſported with paſſion, bites the Rod he ſhould kiſs, and goes on in diſobedience, then his will is rebellious againſt God, and his ſufferance ſhall find no acceptance and ſhall have no remuneration. Thoſe vertues are much eaſier which conſiſt in action, than ſuch as are paſſive and bind us to ſuffer; for the ſcene of the firſt is without us, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſecond within, upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt part of us, our natural deſires and affections. But can we want courage to bear patiently, for Gods ſake, thoſe petty evils and afflicting occurrencies we daily meet withal: when Soldiers bear much more, upon a poor and uncertain account? they expect reſt when they are old, or a fading laurel, and upon the groundleſs hope of this, how much of cold and heat, hunger and wearineſs, pains and dangers, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inconveniencies of all ſorts do they not indure? And we that expect and are ſure of Eternal Reſt within a ſhort time, ſhall we ſhrink for a ſhort labour or a ſhort affliction? ſhall we complain and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, when they chearfully go through a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51153:108"/> much greater miſery? <hi>What ever we ſuffer in this world would be light and eaſie, if we conſider'd what reward God hath aſſigned to our patience.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. AS in building, one ſtone requires more cutting and carving than another, according to the nobler place the Maſter-builder hath aſſigned to it: ſo muſt we go to the divine pleaſure for to know the reaſon why one man ſuffers more than another; for God hath appointed to every man his Croſs, anſwerable to his ſtrength, and to that Crown which is laid up for him. Therefore as the marble deſign'd for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would patiently ſuffer the Carvers ſtrokes, and even be thankful, had it the uſe of ſenſe and reaſon: ſo ſhould we joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and thankfully receive the various afflictions wherewith God, as with a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inſtrument doth poliſh and beautifie us, to exalt us to a higher place of Glory in his Heavenly Palace. He prevents the deviation and ruine of his beloved, by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizing them: and for this the wicked are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51153:108"/> inſtrumental, by their malice and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, they forward the vertue and the happineſs of the juſt. Therefore ſhould we be meek and loving to our enemies, who certainly procure us great advantages: or at leaſt we ſhould look upon them as being commiſſion'd by God, as <hi>David</hi> did upon <hi>Shimei,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.10. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſaid unto him, go and curſe</hi> David, <hi>and who ſhall ſay, wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi> For were it not Gods permiſſion, they could do us no injury: and God would never permit them, but in order to his Glory and our own Salvation. So that in all the wrongs and vexations which we ſuffer, we muſt not ſeek for comfort from created things, for they are vain and vexatious themſelves: but we muſt go directly to God, who hath appointed us all our pains and ſufferings, and will make them beneficial to us, and at laſt will turn them into joy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us therefore look upon afflictions as very neceſſary and uſeful to us: and let us receive them as pledges of Gods love, and aſſurances of his care for us: according as St. <hi>James</hi> exhorts, Jam. 1.2. <hi>My Brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; knowing this, that the tryal of your Faith worketh Patience: but let Patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and intire wanting nothing.</hi> Reproaches, ſlanders, perſecutions, and all other evils
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51153:109"/> we ſuffer in this world, are to be lov'd by pious men and to be counted good: for though they be afflictive to fleſh and bloud, yet they proceed from the divine pleaſure, they come to us from God: and as our Bleſſed Saviour told his unjuſt Judge, John 19.11. <hi>They could have no power at all againſt us, if it were not given them from above:</hi> So that in all events we may meekly ſubmit and reſt ſatisfied, conſidering <hi>this power from above.</hi> And if we do not thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and receive our ſorrows; if we view them by themſelves, and not in their firſt cauſe, that wiſe God who is the contriver of them, and the fountain of all goodneſs: then our minds will be afflicted with a thouſand grievous fancies of things paſt, preſent, or to come, which yet never were or ſhall be: and we ſhall be ſleepleſs and reſtleſs, full of anguiſh and fears and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions. Whereas if we uſed our ſelves to refer all things to God, and did look up to him in our Tribulations, we ſhould find reſt and tranquillity, his gracious will and appointment would anſwer and ſilence all our objections: and whatever hapned we could quietly ſay with patient Job, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil? the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> That God who will have me to be afflicted is gracious and compaſſionate,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51153:109"/> and hath a tender care of me: <hi>He hath laid this croſs upon me, which I reſolve to bear, till he himſelf is pleaſed to take it off.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. IF we grieve more for the Evil men ſpeak againſt us, than for the Evil we our ſelves commit againſt God: then 'tis a plain demonſtration, ſelf-love prevails in us above the love of God. He, infinitely perfect and holy, bears patiently with innumerable blaſphemies and provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the while beſtows many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon the offenders: And we wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinful creatures, who can hardly hear worſe than we deſerve; a diſobliging word, or the leaſt mention of our faults puts us into a fit of anger and fury; though we infinitely deſerve it, we will not bear with reproof or contempt. Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſhould rather fear the undeſerved praiſe of men, leſt the proſperity and honour of the world cut off our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip with the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Should the pains which our ſins
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51153:110"/> deſerve, and the Torments <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered for them, be laid in one ſcale, and in the other, the evils and injuries we ſuffer: theſe would have no weight, and be nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the other. And farther, if it be conſider'd that the injuries we receive, are made grievous according to our own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and not according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our enemies: the diſproportion betwixt our ſufferings and deſerts will appear yet greater. For he cannot be injur'd that ſlights injuries: and he is not wounded that will not by his impatience tear open his wounds. The ſoft fleſh, not the angry hand that flings the dart, is the cauſe of the hurt. <hi>Should a mans body be hard as a rock, arrows thrown againſt it could never enter: and 'tis from the ſoftneſs and frailty of our minds, that reviling words and affronts have power to make impreſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Bleſſed is he that ſo orders his life, that malice it ſelf cannot faſten a calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation upon him: and next to him, bleſſed is he that indeavours to be innocent, and to have a good conſcience in all things: otherwiſe he is a peeviſh fool that will not hear what he delights to do. But if it ſo happen that notwithſtanding our Chriſtian prudence and our perſeverance in well doing, men will ſpeak ill of us: then this is our comfort, that we ſuffer with <hi>Chriſt</hi> undeſervedly, and we muſt remember his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51153:110"/> ſaying, Mat. 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly.</hi> Let men think and ſay what they will, we are happy if our conſcience doth not accuſe us before God. Mens opinions and their judgments are falſe and inconſtant, and vain, and can make us neither better nor worſe; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that if we ſeek to pleaſe men we cannot be the ſervants of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.10. For it is impoſſible for one to pleaſe all; mens thoughts differ as their inclinations: and what ſome admire, others will cenſure. When a Philoſopher was told that others laugh'd at him, he anſwer'd, <hi>At ego non derideor,</hi> that others might laugh, but he was not laugh'd at, for it neither did hurt nor afflict him. Meaning, <hi>that thoſe injuries are nothing, for which we our ſelves will not be concern'd.</hi>

Now all our afflictions proceeding from a preſent or a feared loſs, the beſt and moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal remedy againſt them, would be to ſet our affections upon that ſupreme increated Good, which is ſubject to no change and can never be taken away from them that love it. And that we may alſo obſerve an outward <hi>Decorum,</hi> and not diſgrace our ſelves by giving way to impotent paſſions, we muſt refrain and quite hold in our tongue, as ſoon as we find our ſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by any word or deed: for as it is a ſymptom of a weak ſtomach, not to be able to digeſt harder meat, ſo 'tis a certain ſign of a poor and weakly ſpirit, not to have ſtrength enough to bear with a croſs word or a croſs accident: and it was the ſaying of a Wiſe and Religious man, that he never found any thing ſo grievous, but by ſilence he did overcome it. <hi>For whatever others do to vex us, comes to nothing if we ſlight it: and if we ſhew our ſelves much concern'd, we betray our weakneſs or our guilt, and we make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that we well deſerve the abuſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But 'twill not be enough thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our grief and our talkativeneſs: we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51153:112"/> muſt farther reprove and humble our ſelves with the conſideration of our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unworthineſs, acknowledging we deſerve more contempt than can be here pour'd upon us; for a wiſe and good man, will not only regard what he ſuffers, but what he deſerves to ſuffer for his offences againſt God. Alſo let no man judge and condemn another, remembring the ſaying of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Ro. 2.1. <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O man, for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt, doſt the ſame things.</hi> For 'tis very unfitting, he that owes ten thouſand talents, ſhould be a ſevere exacter of his Brother's mite: and he is a fool that thinks to cure others by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, that is, by his pride and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. <hi>Who art thou</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4.) <hi>that judgeſt another mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. To his own maſter, he ſtandeth or falleth: And how canſt thou ſay to thy Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thy ſelf beholdeſt not the beam that is in thine own eye,</hi> Luke 6.42. God alone that can amend and forgive, or elſe puniſh the ſins of men, hath right to judge of them: our part is to prevent them if we can, or elſe bring men to repentance: however to hide and bear with them: indeavouring firſt to amend our own faults, before we take upon us to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others. <hi>As God is merciful and patient to us all, ſo muſt we be to our Brothers.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. MAny and various are the affairs a man muſt go through in his life, and very different are the humors and companies he muſt converſe withal: ſo that it is next to impoſſible all men ſhould be of his opinion, and all things ſhould fall out according to his mind: therefore he muſt reſolve before hand and be very careful that he loſe not his Peace and his Patience, whatever happen. To that end let him conſider in all his concerns and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, what things may come croſs to his deſires and above his power to help: and having took a view of them, let him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf to bear them if they come. For this will avoid the ſurprize, and leſſen the grief, and compoſe the mind. This muſt be therefore our firſt and chiefeſt task, to underſtand the nature of things, and to uſe them accordingly: as that they may be taken from us; and they are and muſt be ſubject to thouſands of changes and chances, which we cannot hinder; and they are to ſerve, not to command us;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51153:113"/> and withal they are out of our power; ſo that we muſt not be troubled if we cannot diſpoſe of them, as we would.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe conſiderations well weighed will make a wiſe mans mind ſtedfaſt and even; able to entertain all events with a generous indifferency. Is he depriv'd of his good name, of his eſtate or liberty? is he threatned with perſecutions, or with death itſelf? he is not mov'd nor dejected; he had conſider'd long before, that ſuch things might happen whether he would or no, and now he can bear and overcome them. 'Tis not outward things that wound us, but the wrong notion that we have of them; our own miſtaken conceits do us the moſt hurt. No man grows pale with fear or perplext with anguiſh, but he that paſſionately would avoid or obtain that which is not in his power; mind your duty, and let not your paſſions go out of your own ſphere, and you ſhall avoid all thoſe troubles which come from abroad, where mans Juriſdiction cannot reach. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Martyrs were conſtant in the midſt of their wearied tormentors, their patience could not be conquer'd: even women and children were undaunted in the midſt of the flames, they could not be overcome though they might be kill'd: becauſe they valued not thoſe things which Tyrants might give or elſe take away. Things
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51153:114"/> without were nothing to them: but things within, things that were their own, as their vertue, their divine faith and love: theſe they kept and preſerv'd and in ſo doing were happy. <hi>For theſe are the true goods which depend only from our ſelves: and which the world can neither give nor take away from us.</hi>

Will he therefore teach us to make a new world, and ſo bring things out of nothing alſo? No, that belongs only to God. He bids us learn, not what he made, but what he, himſelf was made for us, <hi>Who being in the form of God, yet made himſelf of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taking on him the form of a Servant, and being made in the likeneſs of men,</hi> Phil. 2.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51153:114"/> 
                        <hi>Learn of me</hi> therefore, ſaith he, not to raiſe the dead or caſt out Devils; not to cleanſe lepers or give light to the blind; not to walk on the Sea, or to work ſuch wonders as he enabled ſome to do: but <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,</hi> Mat. 11.29. He would not teach what himſelf would not do, but he himſelf becomes our leſſon, and this he makes the ſum of his wiſdome and his ſaving doctrine, that we learn to be meek and humble after his example. <hi>So great, ſo difficult a thing was lowlineſs, that we could not learn it, but from the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of the moſt higheſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Indeed human pride can be cur'd by none, but him who being God, <hi>yet humbled himſelf and became obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> And humility is the chiefeſt vertue of Chriſtians; proper to them alone; unknown to the Philoſophers and wiſe men of the world; recommended by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his Example and by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, above all other duties: That we following him in his abaſement, might at laſt come to his glory. Now that we may think meanly of our ſelves, we muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider who it is that calls us; the wretched State whence he calls us; the Bliſs he calls us to; our perverſe dulneſs to follow, and the aſſiſtances he gives to forward us. For we ſhall never come to the prize of our high calling, except hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51153:115"/> goes along, and follows our beſt works, which are the ſteps we make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: <hi>Becauſe our vertues ſhall avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing if we be proud of them, and if we ſeek for praiſe and glory here, we ſhall not have any hereafter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If at any time our thoughts be lift up, and we fancy our ſelves to be ſomething, the Earth which is always preſent will tell us whereof we are made and whence we had our origin. For duſt we are, and to duſt we muſt needs return; and upon this humble and low foundation we muſt build the higheſt vertues. For if a man had the gift of miracles and could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; if he could ſpeak all languages and foretel things to come; if he had converted all the infidels, and given all his ſubſtance to the Poor: yet he would be in great and perpetual danger of falling, and loſing his reward by pride; except he were always mindful of his peril and his infirmity: and except diffident of himſelf, he ſtill made it his buſineſs, to work out his Salvation with fear and trembling. <hi>The true wiſdome and ſafety of Chriſtians, is to learn to be humble.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> From God, we turn'd away by Pride, to him we muſt return by humility.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. PRide the firſt and the worſt of ſins took beginning when the Rebellious Angels, proud of their excellency, liſt up themſelves againſt God; ſaying in their curſed ambitious thoughts (as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is thought to mean, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13.) <hi>I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God, I will aſcend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Moſt High.</hi> With the ſame wickedneſs mankind came to be infected, when by the Serpents fraud, <hi>Adam</hi> was perſwaded to aſpire to the being like his Maker, happy in himſelf, without dependance: for, <hi>The beginning of Pride is, when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his maker,</hi> Ecclus. 10.12. And ſo <hi>Pride is the beginning of Sin;</hi> and that with its appendant miſeries, is the inheritance we all derive from our firſt Parents; to ſeek and regard our ſelves in every thing; to forſake God and aim at our own glory and excellency.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:51153:116"/>2. That we may therefore return to God, from whom we are fallen by Pride, we muſt go back in the way of humility; the baſis or foundation whereof, is the ſenſe of our frailty and miſery; the ſincere acknowledgment that we owe nothing to our ſelves, and that we are nothing and can do nothing. For God created mans body out of the Earth, and breathed into him a Soul made out of nothing, and man was adorned with many graces, and was holy and happy: but by ſin he defaced Gods workmanſhip, forfeited all his gifts, and ſo foully defiled himſelf, that nothing in nature can make him clean again. Nay, though by the mercies of our Redemption man hath been reſtored to the poſſibility of bliſs and holineſs, yet by his choiſe and his free-will, he would remain in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate of ſinfulneſs and miſery, ſhould not the Divine Grace actually bring him out of that unhappy condition: ſanctifying his heart, and bringing him into the liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For who but <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Free-Grace, can chuſe and bring a man out of that maſs or heap of perdition, wherein we are all involv'd by nature? If any one puffed up with Pride, anſwer that his Faith, his Prayers is Righteouſneſs, have made the difference betwixt him and them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their corruption, the Apoſtle
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51153:116"/> replies upon him, but <hi>What haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not receiv'd it?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. Again ſaith he in another place, 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>We are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of our ſelves to think any thing, as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> And, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour: that no fleſh ſhould glory before him, but as it written, <hi>He that glories ſhould glory in the Lord.</hi> Sinners can have no juſt cauſe to glory in themſelves: neither can the Juſt glory but in him, to whom they ſing with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou O Lord art my glory, and the lifter up of my head,</hi> Pſal. 3.3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But may not a man glory that he hath not rejected Gods gracious offers? This if he did, would be the ſame folly as if a man ſhould boaſt, that whereas he could have made himſelf miſerable, and drown'd himſelf if he would, yet he had not done it. But yet even our receiving Gods free benefits, proceeds from a new mercy: which were it denyed us, and ſhould Grace withdraw from us her light and aſſiſtance, we ſhould neither value the gifts of God, nor know how to uſe them aright. We muſt therefore mortifie the deſire of our own glory, as we deſire God would make and account us righteous; let the ſincere love of God make us deſpiſe the praiſe of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51153:117"/> men; let truth take place, we have no cauſe to glory in any thing, for nothing good is our own. This is the ground and the perfection of all true vertue, to know and be truly perſwaded that we are, and have, and can do nothing of our ſelves: for it is God that works in us to will and to do. Therefore let us fear and beware, for God who gives grace to the humble, doth take it away from the Proud.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. PRide is a ſwelling or lifting up of the mind, whereby the man would reach and ſtretch himſelf beyond his narrow bounds, and attribute that to himſelf which is not his own. This is joyn'd with an high conceit of himſelf and of his great worth, which he indeavours to propagate to others, boaſting upon all occaſions his birth, dignities and riches, and thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of body and mind, which he thinks make him great and mighty, and much ſuperior to others. This opinion gets ſtrength, and the mans Spirit grows more high and arrogant, if he hath withal
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51153:117"/> great Riches and a great Retinue, ſtately Houſes and Garments, Gold, Jewels, and all ſuch Ornaments, as are the effects and the ſigns of mens vanities. Then he muſt have great Titlet, loud Applauſes, and much Reverence from others, to teſtifie that they acknowledge him for their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. And theſe he counts the ſovereign happineſs of this life: and as for life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, he minds it not, and he cares not for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence proceeds a great averſion and hatred againſt all things that betray his weakneſs and defects, and this being in any thing inferior to others. Hence Anger and ſullen diſcontent, when any thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens or is diſcover'd, which reflects ſome diſgrace and leſſens his excellency. Hence a perpetual fear, leſt what he undertakes ſhould not ſucceed to his credit. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all men generally ſeek to be ſeen and to be commended: even ordinary people in the meaneſt imployments ſeek to excell others of the ſame calling, and to make an oſtentation of their skill. Nay the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers themſelves affected praiſe, whilſt they ſpake againſt it: and they aim'd at glory, writing brave things for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it. The infection of Pride runs ſecretly, and is hardly to be diſcern'd: and when the beſt of men think to have plucked up by the root that curſed plant
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51153:118"/> out of their hearts: yet there remain ſmall ſlips and ſtrings, which will bud forth, though they cannot be found out. We muſt therefore love and follow the truth, and utterly deſpiſe vain ſhews and falſe praiſes: and with a ſtrict obſervation, and the fear of the juſt and all-ſeeing God, we muſt kill and ſtifle all proud and vain-glorious thoughts. As ſmoke riſing out of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, becomes a great cloud and darkens the Sun, but being but ſmoke is ſoon blown away: ſo he mounts up aloft, that is high-minded and proud, and diffuſeth himſelf to obſcure others, and thereby grows thin and puffed up with wind, and wanting the ſolidneſs of vertue, he ſoon paſſeth away and comes to nothing. <hi>I have ſeen the wicked in great power and ſpreading himſelf like a green bay-tree: yet he paſſed away, and lo, he was not: yea, I ſought him, but he could not be found.</hi> Pſal. 37.35.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. OUR ſtation is very ſlippery, and the heavy burthen of our corrupt nature doth perpetually weigh us down: ſo that, without Gods right hand uphold us, we can neither ſtand, nor yet walk firmly, we are always in danger of falling. If we have not fallen into grievous crimes, 'tis Gods gracious providence hath remov'd the occaſions from us: elſe we too well know by experience, how weak we are in the neighbourhood or under the aſſaults of a temptation. If any good thing be in us, it is very ſmall and imperfect: and if the leaſt detect can marr the beſt work, who who then can ſay he hath ever done any thing altogether good and without any mixture of evil? Who is there indeavours after perfection and is as careful of his Salvation, as are the children of this world for pleaſure and riches? And are we not all conſcious of many great ſins, of the pardon whereof we can hardly be certain, becauſe that depends upon our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51153:119"/> which ſtill remains many ways im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect? Nay, if we were ſure of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of what is paſt, yet have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear for the future, leſt we fall and periſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whoever ſhall duly conſider all this, how little is our vertue and our aſſurance, how great our danger and frailty, will hardly pride or truſt himſelf in any thing: but will find much cauſe to tremble, and trembling to acknowledge that he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and of himſelf can do nothing. As when the Sun goes away, the Air imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately becomes dark: ſo doth the Soul grow blind and impotent, as ſoon as God withdraws his light and gracious aſſiſtance. He that rightly underſtands this truth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire, it may be known to others alſo: and he that acknowledgeth from his heart, that he deſerves nothing but ſhame and confuſion, cannot refuſe to bear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, without oppoſing the known truth. <hi>Truth and humility are inſeparable: and he therefore is always moſt humble, that is beſt acquainted with the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It were an eaſie thing for a man to riſe again after he is fallen, if he would ſoon repair to the ſpiritual Phyſician, and from him receive help and directions: but whilſt men are poſſeſt with a ſpirit of pride, that they will not ſee their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or they fancy they can cure it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51153:119"/> they remain for the moſt part where they fall, and wallow in the mire till they die: and that becauſe they would not flee to God for ſuccor, and uſe thoſe means which he hath appointed; but they count the preſcriptions of the Phyſician worſe than the diſeaſe, flattering themſelves they ſhould do well enough, and by their own applications making the evil deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. For no man is more unhappy and ſure to periſh than he who being blind yet fancies he can clearly ſee: becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting he wants no mans aſſiſtance to guide him, is like to fall into every ditch, and into the great Precipice it ſelf. But let a man learn to know himſelf, according to the old ſaying, which was ſaid to have come from Heaven, <hi>Noſce teipſum, know thy ſelf:</hi> for then he ſhall know that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he can do nothing but fall and periſh; but that in God is his ſtrength and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Many lie down in their bondage, and faint under the burthen of their ſins; becauſe they will not be helpt, and they will not by humble prayer, ſeek to God for help; and in him truſt, of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays, <hi>I can do all things through</hi> Chriſt <hi>which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> Phil. 4.13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To yield and loſe heart is deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: but true humility will raiſe us up, and make us chearfully undertake and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the moſt difficult duties: confiding
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51153:120"/> in his gracious help, who for us became man that he might make us partakers of the Divine Nature. As an Iron red hot, burns by the fire that penetrates its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not of it ſelf: ſo a man becomes fervent and inflam'd, not of his dull na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the fire of Divine Charity which God kindles in him: as alſo when he is ſaid to ſhine before men, it is by vertue of that divine light of Truth and Wiſdome, which God ſends in his heart. Man of himſelf can do nothing; he is but an inſtrument in Gods hand, from whom he receives power to will and to do; it is God that works all our works in us, as the Scripture ſaith. For if the Divine Love, and Light, and Wiſdom, depart from a man: he preſently becomes Dark, Cold, and Unactive, uſeleſs as an Inſtrument without an Artiſt. <hi>Man of himſelf being nothing, and fit for nothing, muſt dwell in the ſenſe of his nothingneſs, as in his Center: for then he is moſt ſtrong in God, when he is moſt ſenſible of his own weakneſs.</hi>

But woe to that Soul which ſoars high in lofty conceits, and dwells much abroad in vain inquiries: for then ſhe remains unknown to her ſelf, unacquainted with her own miſery, and thoſe her errors and failings, ſhe ſhould watch over and amend. Yet this is the caſe of many, and a ſad caſe it is, to ſee wretched, ignorant and vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, take no notice of their own follies: but prie into others infirmities, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their leaſt miſcarriages: and this

But 'tis not ſo with upright men that indeavour to know themſelves, for the greater profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents they are in that knowledge, the more humble they are and concern'd for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, perceiving their great diſtance from perfection and true holineſs: and finding ſo much work at home, the leſs they mind others, except where it is their duty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is the true diſcipline of the Saints, to exerciſe ther zeal againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to bear patiently with the faults of others: for he that cannot bear with the imperfections of others, is himſelf the moſt imperfect. As God in Nature produc'd all things out of nothing: ſo in Grace he produceth all vertues out of a mans hearty perſwaſion of being nothing, out of the ſenſe of his own ſinfulneſs. That is true vertue that will bear with ſcorns, contempt, and injuries: being grounded upon humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: but if this fails, vertue is but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, a vain oftentation, and an empty name. <hi>He gathers duſt before the wind, that is not humble, and yet would be vertuous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. But he is to be counted truly humble, who is more lowly than the loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and higher than the higheſt: who is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51153:121"/> not lift up with honours, nor ſwelled with the wind of mens applauſes: and who is never ſo much afflicted and diſgrac'd, but he is perſwaded he deſerves much worſe. He is truly humble who is willing to be vile in the eyes of others, as he ever is in his own: who if he hath advanc'd an untruth is not aſham'd to retract it: and to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of others, if by ſurprize or any other way, he hath offended them in word or deed; this is known to good men to be a great ſelf-denyal. He is truly humble that is careful to do nothing for which he may juſtly be deſpiſed, and yet he is content to be ſo: and meekly bears with reproches, grieving for the offence to God, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in his own abaſement. He whoſe moſt innocent actions are miſunderſtood and miſreported, who is diſappointed of his due reward, and requited evil for good, and yet is patient and contented, makes it appear that he neither values himſelf nor his beſt actions. The humble man is ſilent of himſelf and dead to the world: and when he is forſaken and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, yet in God he finds refuge and comfort. He is decently courteous and obliging to all perſons, even to them that are his inferiors. He compares what is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him, to the gifts of God in others, his imperfections to their vertues: and ſo entertains always mean thoughts
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51153:122"/> of himſelf, and is content to have others prefer'd before him, and to ſit low and be conceal'd in his humility. I might add that humility will make a man obedient to his ſuperiors, meek and peaceable under Government, and always ready to believe better of the goodneſs and wiſdome of his Rulers than of his own: but theſe muſt ſuffice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This is a rude draught and but an imperfect Image of that lovely creature called an Humble Chriſtian: whereby yet a man may diſcern how unlike he muſt be to the original, that comes not near to the copy. That is, how far he is from being maſter of that bleſſed vertue, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Bleſſed Lord, did ſo much recommend to his followers, by his loweſt and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful humiliation. In the exerciſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there is no danger of exceſs; we can never be too humble: but we may eaſily not be humble enough, here the danger is great, as the crime alſo. As he that would come in at a door which is low of entrance, if he bows himſelf more than needs, there is no harm done; but if he comes too up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and never ſo little too high, he muſt bruiſe his head, if not break his skull: ſo the loweſt humility will never hurt the Soul, but the leaſt Pride may deſtroy it. Let a Chriſtian therefore to avoid this danger, not onely not exalt himſelf, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51153:122"/> even not equal himſelf to others. For in ſo doing he ſhall beſt imitate the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus, who being Son of God, yet took on him the form of a ſervant, that be might ſhew to us the true form of humility.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of the Conformity of our Will to Gods.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WE can offer to God nothing more pleaſing, no victim better and more acceptable, than our own will; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to reſign that to God, and deſire that in all things it may be ſubject and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his bleſſed will, is that living and holy ſacrifice wherein God delights, which none but a Pious man can offer, and which is the higheſt act of Religion we can perform on Earth. For in this ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and conforming our will to the Divine pleaſure, we offer not to God any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing alone: but our whole ſelves, Body and Soul, and all that we have without any reſervation. Therefore we ſhould make that our daily ſtudy; thus to deny and forſake our ſelves, to empty our hearts of all ſelf-deſires and ſelf-affections, that even here, God may be all in all in us, and we may be wholly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51153:123"/> devoted to him; prepared and willing to be in all things diſpoſed of by him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſhall think good. For God will not work in us his good and acceptable will, if we have a will of our own, diſtinct from, and contrary to his; he requires the whole heart, and he that gives leſs, gives nothing. It may be allowed indeed to human frailty, that we ſhould wiſh and will after the manner of men: but then we muſt ſoon recollect our ſelves, and lifting up our heart to God, lay our will in the duſt, that we may acquieſce in him, and cleave to him, who being the Sovereign hath abſolute dominion over all. He is the Creator, we are his Creatures; he is the Lord, we are all his Servants; he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, we are weak and infirm: we muſt therefore reſtrain our own, and give up our ſelves wholly to his Bleſſed will, ſaying in all contingencies, <hi>Not as I will, O Lord, but as thou wilt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thus Prayed our Bleſſed Redeemer, when he acted for us, and ſuffered in our ſtead: not that he whoſe Godhead is one with the Father, could will any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him: but to teach us how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves, in reſigning all our deſires to God. Therefore he alſo taught us to make it our daily Prayer, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> that as the Angels are always ready to fulfil God's will,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51153:123"/> we may be ſo likewiſe; in all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be obedient to his laws and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; That that unhappy fight and contention may be taken away, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Gal. 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> That ſo God's will may be obeyed by the whole Man, Body, Soul, and Spirit, without any oppoſition or reluctancy: and Nature may be governed by Grace, and Human affections be changed into Holy Charity: for this is the will of God, even our Sanctification. <hi>There is one onely God, and he that cleaves to him, is one with him in Spirit and in Will, and cannot but be Holy and Happy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is not a more excellent duty than to receive whatever happens as coming from Gods hand, with a quiet and a contented mind: <hi>caſting all our care upon him, for he careth for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. There is no true evil, but the evil of ſin; all other things ſo counted, do proceed from God; <hi>Proſperity and Adverſity, Life and Death, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Riches come of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Ecclus. 11.14. Therefore God ſaith by his Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I form the Light and create Darkneſs; I make Peace and create Evil; I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> Whereas therefore all things, even thoſe that ſeem to be moſt accidental, depend upon Gods moſt wiſe determinations and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51153:124"/> ſecret counſels, we muſt ſubmit our ſelves to his moſt gracious Providence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the moſt afflictive events as ſigns of his care and good will for us: caſting our ſelves into the arms of his infinite mercies, and ſuffering him to fit us for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by what means he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Slanders, Treacheries, Oppreſſions, Loſſes, Rapes, Thefts, Sickneſſes, Plagues, Famines, and all other calamities publick or private, they are all ſent and appointed by God, for to puniſh or reclaim wicked men, or elſe to exerciſe and perfect the Righteous: therefore under the ſenſe or apprehenſion of any of theſe, let a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian humble himſelf and worſhip, and ſay with patient <hi>Job, Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Maſters commit their work and their affairs to truſty ſervants, and yet acquaint them not with their ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and all the train of their deſigns: ſo ſhould we like faithful and humble ſervants, yield to God chearfully an active or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience, in all things: unconcern'd for the final event, how in any particulars God will diſpoſe of us or of others; taking that to our ſelves which our Bleſſed Lord told St. <hi>Peter</hi> once, <hi>What is that to thee? follow thou me;</hi> follow me, whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and mind nothing elſe. If thou art entred upon a good deſign, ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table undertaking, and canſt not go on
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51153:124"/> with it by reaſon of ſickneſs or ſome other hindrance which thou canſt not help, grieve not and be not dejected, for God knows what is beſt for thee; follow him whereſoever he calls. <hi>Thus if we would meekly entertain Gods will and be guided by it, Peace and Tranquillity would dwell in our hearts, and perturbations could have no acceſs to the place wherein God dwells and reigns.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of the Reſignation of our ſelves to God in all things.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. 'TIS good to wiſh that God would afflict us, and that we may ſuffer for him and from him: but 'tis yet better to be wholly devoted to him, ſo as to follow without anxiouſneſs or reluctancy, whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is pleaſed to lead. Natural life ſhews it ſelf by the acts of ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Spiritual life, by the ceſſation of thoſe acts: when we no longer live our ſelves, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> lives in us. For he that truly forſakes himſelf, and transfers the motions of his mind, and the liberty of his will to God, lives here as a new born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, without choiſe or deſires of his own;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51153:125"/> having wholly permitted himſelf to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine guidance, he is free from himſelf, and lives the life of Grace. In all croſs acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, he looks and reſts upon Providence, and of all the World calls nothing his own: becauſe he himſelf is not his own, but Gods, in whoſe hand he is as an inſtrument, to be done with and put to ſuch uſe as the Maſter ſhall pleaſe. He is not curious and inquiſtive after Divine ſecret Counſels, but he adores them, and believes them to be always juſt and equitable: and therefore in what matter, and for what cauſe ſoever God is pleaſed to determine any thing, he aſſents, and yields, and thinks it beſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He depends upon God for all the concerns of Nature, of Grace and Glory: and diveſting himſelf of his own liberty, he chuſeth Gods will and makes it his own. And whereas by natural corruption man hath too much complacency in himſelf, and delights in the beſt acts of his will, rather as his own, than as good, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed many troubles: he that hath parted with his own will, to make it one with Gods, ſuffers no grief in himſelf nor any creature, but always rejoyceth in his acquieſcence to the Divine pleaſure. At beſt, if natural affections cannot be quite ſubdued, yet this prevails; and the man eaſily overcomes his ſorrows, and finds in God peace and ſatisfaction. <hi>None can reſiſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51153:125"/> the Almighty, he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him, and his will muſt abſolutely take place in all things: therefore better it is willingly to follow than be drag'd: better it is to comply with, than to be forc'd by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our content and tranquillity conſiſts in our meek ſubjection to the will of God. And even if we have fallen into great and miſchievous ſins, though we are ſeriouſly to repent, to chaſtiſe and afflict our ſelves: yet we muſt not give way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting perturbations, and a tedious and confuſed ſpirit: but rather we muſt humbly implore the Divine mercy which permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to fall, that we might not be high-minded but fear, and be ſenſible of our own frailty in our fall, and of the Divine Grace, when we riſe up again and ſtand: we muſt patiently wait upon God, and beg for Pardon and the return of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with a contrite heart: and without impatience or amazement, make it our diligent ſtudy and indeavour to mortifie our ſins and amend our lives. A faithful and wiſe ſervant under God, ſeeks and deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that his Lords commands may be fulfilled: he will always be diſpoſed to ſay from his heart, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> I am ready to do and ſuffer thy pleaſure: <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> Mat. 11.26. Wilt thou grant me health and plenty, and inward peace and joy:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51153:126"/> or wilt thou have me be poor and ſickly, and to live in mournful ſadneſs and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual drineſs: thy will be done, do with me what thou pleaſeſt, for I am wholly thine.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This preparedneſs of mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to all things that God ſhall pleaſe to ſend, will free a man from all anxious troubles and fears, and from being caſt down; nay, will make him undaunted, always peaceable or always victorious in all adverſities. We are forbidden by our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be ſolicitous about food and raiment, how much more about ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things, which miniſter only to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We muſt do our duty and leave all to God, and reſt our ſelves upon his gracious and Almighty will: for even the peace of the Soul is loſt if it be ſought too anxiouſly. Too much care and inquiſitiveneſs after things to come, betray a timerous and unſettled mind, not yet reſign'd to God, and are the effects of ſelf-love afraid to ſuffer any thing. <hi>God who ſees all things from above, knows what is beſt for every man; and he ſweetly and powerfully diſpoſing all things, takes a ſpecial care of that man, that depends and relies upon him.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> That the Hope of our Salvation muſt reſt upon God.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. A Man guided by the Chriſtian wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, will not only, as the Goſpel commands, leave all temporal things to Gods diſpoſal, taking no thought for the morrow: but alſo commit his Soul and Salvation to him, who never faileth them that truſt in him. In this hope, and in conforming his will to Gods will, he will work out his Salvation; admiring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling together the Divine Juſtice and Mercy: and yet not ſeeking to enter into the deep abyſs of Gods ſecret judgments and decrees; a bold preſumption which belongs to none but to wicked impenitents, whoſe deſperate Lives make their Souls deſperate, becauſe they will not leave their ſins and return to God. 'Tis true indeed that no man without a ſpecial Revelation, can have a ſpecial aſſurance of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but we have that which is as good to ſecure us againſt deſpair, and to ground an holy and comfortable hope upon. That
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51153:127"/> we are redeemed by the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and devoted to him in Holy Baptiſm, and that God is our confidence and refuge: always ready to help them that call upon him, and to forgive them that beg for pardon, with tears and contrition, and a ſerious purpoſe of amendment. And many more great and precious aſſurances we have that <hi>God hath given us eternal life, and that this life is in his Son;</hi> ſo that all his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are to fit us for it, if we do not wilfully fruſtrate all his ſaving methods and purpoſes: Only he would have our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be hid and ſecret, that ſecurity may not breed in us pride and negligence, and that <hi>he that thinketh he ſtandeth ſhould take heed leſt he fall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now therefore, becauſe the choſen are few, let every true Chriſtian live a Holy Life with the few, that he may make his Calling and Election ſure, and be counted worthy at laſt to receive the Crown of Life with the few. <hi>Streight is the way and narrow is the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13. Therefore we muſt walk in that narrow way, and that always with care and fear, even when we ſeem to run with moſt ſpeed, becauſe no man in reſpect of himſelf is abſolutely ſure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. Yet our fear muſt not proceed ſo far as to make us faint, but only to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51153:127"/> make us wary, and make us put our truſt and confidence in God, and with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubmiſſion caſt our ſelves upon him, both for time and eternity. If any one objects that he knows not how Gods will is affected towards him; I anſwer that Gods promiſes are ſincere, and muſt be received as they are generally ſet forth in Holy Scripture, to all that will obey Gods revealed will: and moreover that his own will is much more uncertain, ſo that it is much more ſafe to truſt Gods, for God we are certain is infinitely good. <hi>He is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proud and unhappy withal that relies on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more than upon God: but happy is he that confides in that gracious Lord whoſe mercies and promiſes are ſure for ever, and in whom whoſoever truſted was never confounded.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THough it be by vertue of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, that we are, and are called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet the Life or Soul of our Religion is Charity or the Love of God, whereby we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51153:128"/> are enabled to live godly, as becomes Chriſtians. For as God, by his great love wherewith he loved us, ſent his dear Son into the world, to die for us, that we might live through him: ſo are we to love God moſt affectionately, with all our heart and ſtrength, and our Neighbour as our ſelves, for his ſake. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins. Love therefore is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment on which depends the Law and the Prophets. Love is the foundation and excellency of our Faith, to know the love of God which paſſeth knowledge, that when we were enemies we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him by the death of his Son. Love is that fire which our Bleſſed Redeemer came to ſend in the Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. which coſt him much to kindle, and which burns up mens droſs and impurities, and cannot be put out but where iniquity doth abound. And Love is the ſpirit of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, who had one heart and one mind: and is even the Soul of the whole Church, whereby it is united and lives.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> left and appointed Love as the mark whereby his followers ſhould be known, Joh. 13.35. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> And ſo in the love of God conſiſts our union with him, and it is the higheſt perfection
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51153:128"/> of the Chriſtian life. Now perfection is the work of Grace; therefore we muſt not relie upon our own ſtrength, but we muſt beg of God daily and devoutly that by his good Spirit, he would kindle in our hearts the fire of an holy Charity, that by it we may be guided, quickned, and at laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Neither yet muſt we loſe heart, if we ſometimes fall, as if all our hope were in our own ſtrength: but we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our own infirmity, and riſe quickly, and pray more fervently, and afterwards fight more couragiouſly. Still purſuing after perfection, not only in words or ineffective wiſhes, but in hearty deſires and ſerious indeavours: manifeſting our love by daily mortifying our ſins, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to new and higher degrees of vertue. And then ſhall a Chriſtian be moſt, perfect and happy, when his heart ſhall be empty of himſelf, and free from the love of the world, but purified and burning with the love of God.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. HE is a juſt and holy man who rightly values things according to their worth, and alſo loves them propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably; for ſin is duly by wiſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to be a diſorderly Love, and vertue to be a regular and well placed Love. And though there be other natural affections, yet they all proceed from and depend upon love, and if this be well placed and governed as it ſhould, the reſt cannot be unruly. It is vertue to love what deſerves to be lov'd: and wiſdome to make choiſe of it, and conſtancy to purſue it through all dangers and ſufferings: and to be drawn from it by no inticements, is temperance: and to prefer nothing to it is juſtice: and the order of Love muſt follow the order of things: and ſo God is to be lov'd infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more than any creature, becauſe he is infinitely better, more perfect and lovely. We become good and pure, by loving him who is the fountain of all goodneſs
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51153:129"/> and purity: for our manners follow our affections; we become either vertuous or vicious according to the nature of what we moſt love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The true object of Love is God, our Neighbour and our ſelves. God in the firſt place to whom all love is due, and from whom it muſt paſs to other creatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are more or leſs like him. By this, we muſt love our Neighbour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is, or that he may be juſt: and we muſt love our ſelves, in that we are, or elſe that we may be holy: taking from God the meaſure of our Love to all other things, that our Love may be regular and we may be happy. Let no man therefore love ſin, for thereby he hates and deſtroys his Soul: and let no man love himſelf for his own ſake, but upon Gods account, who is the chiefeſt Good, in whom alone we can be intirely happy. For God who alone is the Author of our being and well-being, hath ſet theſe bounds to our affections, that we ſhould love him with all our heart and with all our Soul; that we ſhould conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to the ſervice of that Love, our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, our life, and all our powers; and that if we love any thing elſe, it be in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and in ſubordination to him that deſerves all our Love, and ſhould be the maſter and diſpoſer of it. <hi>The love of God muſt therefore lead the way to what elſe we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51153:130"/> ſhould love; it muſt always prevail and be the rule of all our affections, and then we cannot love nor do amiſs.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of the Neceſſity and Meaſures of Loving our Neighbour.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WE cannot love God as we ſhould, without we love our Neighbour, neither can we love our Neighbour except we love God. <hi>If any man ſaith, I love God and hateth his Brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? and this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, loveth his Brother alſo,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20. The Commandment makes no exception; though the man be poor, though he be a ſtranger, nay, though he be vicious and thine enemy, yet he is thy Neighbour and thy Brother, and he muſt be lov'd. The expreſſions of thy love may vary according to his needs and thine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. Yet they muſt be hearty, real, and effective: for, <hi>The End of the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience and of Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained,</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:51153:130"/> 1 Tim. 1.5. And we <hi>muſt not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved us and gave himſelf for us, not that we deſerv'd any love, but becauſe he lov'd God, and us in God, to whom he purchaſt us; ſo muſt we love all men, not for ours or their ſakes, but for God's ſake, having no further regard to what is good in them, than only as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to God. True Chriſtians are ſo ſtrictly united together by love, that what one hath not in himſelf, he with joy finds it in others, and what one hath more than the reſt, he willingly imparts it to all. As by our love to God, we are united and in ſome manner become one ſpirit with him: ſo by the mutual love of men, of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans eſpecially, they become one among themſelves, ſo that what one hath to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is for the good of all, and what one hath not in himſelf, he hath and enjoys in others. Thus love is the fulfilling of the Law, and the fulfilling of all Righteouſneſs. <hi>According as is the mans Charity, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, progreſs, or perfection, ſo is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his righteouſneſs: and then moſt perfect in this life, when even life it ſelf is parted with for love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>modus</hi> or meaſure of love to our Neighbour is twofold, poſitive and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Firſt, To do to him as we would he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51153:131"/> ſhould do to us. Secondly, And not to deal with him any otherwiſe, than as we would he ſhould deal with us. Every one therefore, in the ſight of God to whom all things are known, muſt conſider ſeriouſly what he would others ſhould do, or not do to him: and if he deſires others ſhould he patient towards him, and bear with his faults and infirmities, and ſpeak well of him, &amp;c. Then let him be careful to do ſo to others. 'Tis a ſure indication of a perverſe heart for a man in a private capacity, to do that to another, which he ſhould be ſorry to ſuffer himſelf. A good Chriſtian doth not inquire into the manners and faults of others, but leaves them to his view and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to whom all judgment is given. He examines, judgeth, and puniſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and makes ſelf-reformation his ſerious and conſtant buſineſs. Whatever he ſees or hears his mind is undiſturb'd and abides in peace: for if it be good, he praiſeth God, if evil, he turns it to good, by turning his mind from it towards God in Prayers and Reſignation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If his Office and Charity obligeth him to reprove and to correct others, he doth it with a zeal ſweet and benign, and compaſſionate to his Brothers infirmity: for roughneſs and ungovern'd paſſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt with Charity. If the ill actions of others are capable of an excuſe, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51153:131"/> them; however he cenſures not: knowing that nothing human is ſo perfect and holy, but may be ill interpreted, and at the beſt may be ſome way defectuous enough, to be liable to reprehenſion, if car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping men let looſe their cenſorious humors. Whilſt men are men, they will have ſome imperfections, and to be zealous againſt them, is under pretence of preciſeneſs, to give way to peeviſh impatience or proud cenſoriouſneſs. <hi>He that is too buſie to tax and judge others, will never grow better him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> True Friendſhip and the true Offices of it.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. FRiendſhip is the communion of good things, and therefore it follows the nature of thoſe things which friends have common. Now there being nothing truly good, but things ſupernatural and eternal, true friendſhip muſt conſiſt in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of theſe mutually. Hence it is that carnal friendſhip is ſoon diſſolved, becauſe things of ſenſe cannot laſt, nor always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the ſpirit: whereas ſpiritual friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51153:132"/> is never broken; for though it may ſeem to be interrupted by little angers and contentions, yet true piety and the love of God ſweetens the harſhneſs of them, and keeps the knot indiſſoluble. As for that friendſhip which too much ſets our hearts upon any perſon, and may be called Doting, it ſhould be ſtifled and avoided, as being miſchievous, and it is to be known by theſe tokens; when the party belov'd is always in our thoughts and we can never be well without him; when we fear his diſpleaſure above all things, when in him we reſt as in our center, and we ſacrifice to him all our actions and moſt important concerns. And let none flatter themſelves that this is pure innocent friendſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſelf-intereſt: for it is altogether ſenſual, it depraves the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is an enemy to all wiſdom and true Religion, and it begins and ends in the fleſh; and 'tis to be obſerv'd, that this kind of friendſhip is never betwixt perſons truly good and vertuous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Men of real worth are always well compoſed, grave, and of a ſweet deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they are courteous to all, but they are familiar to few, and they flatter none: in their converſation, modeſty, diſcretion, an exact juſtice, and an unaffected ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be obſerved. They ſeek not to make a ſhew outwardly, their life is inward and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51153:132"/> ſecret, they live to God and to their own conſcience. They fairly converſe with men outwardly, when it is fitting: but their heart cleaves to God, and they will not diſturb themſelves with the ſilly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies or petty concerns of the world: Their deſigns and affections differ much from the vulgar multitude, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their words and actions are guided with greater and more divine wiſdome, they proceed from a higher principle, and they tend to an end much more excellent. Their ſoul and converſation, their treaſure and joys are all in Heaven, and if thither they draw not others after them, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe health propagates not it ſelf as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers do. <hi>Mans nature is corrupt, and now infections are catching, but cures are difficult.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Men are ſociable by nature, and by a certain inſtinct they generally ſeek to pleaſe others, and to be loved by them: but that friendſhip which they ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after, will never be ſincere nor laſting, except their ſouls meet and are joyn'd in the love of God. That friendſhip which conſiſts only in the reciprocation of civil offices, is but a kind of a traffick, and it abides no longer than whilſt men can be uſeful one to another. That courteouſneſs and obligingneſs which friends ſo ſtrictly exact one of another, is but a vain deceit
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51153:133"/> or paſtime, or at the beſt a game at words: and many that play beſt at it and with moſt readineſs, are they that cheat you moſt; they talk and promiſe gracefully and at a high rate, but theſe are but wind and come to nothing, when realities are wanting, and effects be required. Whereas if God were poſſeſt of mens hearts by Holy Charity, he would make their love to their Neighbours hearty and ſincere; there would be no contentions, no envies, no diſcords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; they would dwell in peace and a happy union together, every one not following his own will and deſires: but all conſpiring together in the will of God and his good pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Self-love and ſelf-intereſt are the ſpring of all diviſions, for men therefore eſteem not their Neighbours nor ſeek their advantage, except it be for ſome ends of their own. Let a man be a great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or a great Mathematician, very Learned or very Religious, few care for that, and few love him therefore: but if he be Rich and Prodigal withal, multitudes worſhip him and run after him. Vertue and Learning are valued by few, but many love and admire the money, and thence many wars and enmities, and many Law-ſuits do proceed. Man commonly loves not himſelf, becauſe he is partaker with others of humanity, but for ſome things
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51153:133"/> which he fancies peculiar to himſelf: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lives not as he ſhould to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, loving others, eſpecially Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for what they have common with him: but by his imaginary particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies he ſeparates himſelf from the reſt of mankind, and upon that account cheriſheth himſelf, and cares for none elſe but for his own ſake, This well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered will make a wiſe man deſpiſe much the friendſhip of the men of this world. He will not purpoſely do any thing to get their hatred, but yet he will not much value their good words, and their fine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. <hi>Privacy and ſilence will be pleaſant to him, and his delight will be in converſing with God, in whom alone all joys and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are to be found.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Of the ſeveral Acts of Charity to our Neighbours.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WE are never without an occaſion to ſhew our love to our Brothers: for ſo great and various are the miſeries of human nature, either corporal or ſpiritual, that we can hardly look or ſtep, without
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51153:134"/> finding objects of Charity. Even the beſt of men want our hearty Prayers that they may perſevere: for ſuch is our weakneſs, and ſuch the ſtrength of our enemies, that no man can be ſecure in this world: and many ſtrong ones have been known fall ſuddenly and irrecoverably at the aſſault of an ordinary and often baffled temptation. And how much want they our aſſiſtance and our prayers, that are faſt tyed with the bonds of their ſins, that they may not periſh in their dungeon and unhappy ſlavery. This is the caſe of all Infidels and Hereticks, beſides many vicious Chriſtians, who all together croud in the broad way to deſtruction, and heedleſly go down to Hell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Bodily miſeries alſo are frequently to be met with, and are altogether paſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Many are afflicted with hunger, thirſt and nakedneſs, with debts and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and natural infirmities: Many are perſecuted and oppreſt, reviled and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, impriſon'd and begger'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually vext and diſtracted. And many ſtruggle with the terrors of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the fear and approaches of death, and the amazements of that laſt moment, on which depends Eternity. To all theſe our pitty and charity is to be extended, as God ſhall enable us; by alms, by counſel or comfort, by prayers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51153:134"/> and by any means that are in our power. Chriſt <hi>accepts as done to himſelf, what good we do for his ſake to the afflicted: and in the great day of recompences, he will bountifully reward Charity.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVIII.</hi> Charity is alſo due to our Enemies.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. TO love our Enemies is the higheſt and moſt divine vertue, and the ſum of Chriſtian perfection, which our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour moſt earneſtly recommends, and abſolutely enjoyns to all his Diſciples, ſaying, Mat. 6.44. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you: that you may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</hi> This Law is hard to fleſh and bloud, therefore the Law-giver raiſeth his ſubjects minds above all things earthly and natural, even to the higheſt glory and priviledges of Heaven. <hi>That ye may be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the children of your Father which is in Heaven:</hi> that deſpiſing our firſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51153:135"/> carnal birth, we may live according to this ſecond, whereof the honours and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in Chriſt, are ſo much above all we could hope from <hi>Adam.</hi> Enough certainly to make us chearfully comply with our duty, in this particular; not only to love but alſo to do good to our enemies, to ſpeak well of them, and to pray for them. And yet we are bound to this alſo by our greateſt intereſt, for except we thus forgive, and requite good for evil, our heavenly father will not forgive us our ſins, nor receive us into favour again, as our Bleſſed Saviour plainly aſſerts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.15. and 18.35.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe exhorts us, Rom. 12.20. <hi>If thine enemy hunger feed him, if he thirſt give him drink.</hi> And, <hi>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> Men may be too ſtrong for us, that we cannot help: but we cannot be overcome of evil, except we pleaſe our ſelves. For to be overcome, is to hate them that do evil to us, and to ſeek to revenge it upon them, and 'tis in our power to do otherwiſe if we will; we may overcome evil with good, in pitying and forgiving thoſe that hate and injure us, and doing good to them, when we have occaſion. But this is better underſtood and perſwaded by Holy Charity, than by all argumentations and learned diſcourſes: Wee need not fear therefore the evils men can do to us, but thoſe we do againſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51153:135"/> our ſelves by an angry, impatient, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Spirit. Let us but pray and labour for Chriſtian Charity, and it will make us invincible, it will make us conquer and overcome all wrongs and afflictions. <hi>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the flouds drown it.</hi> Cant. 8.7. The waters of Calamities and Perſecutions, cannot put out that bright and ever-burning flame, kindled by God in pious hearts.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXIX.</hi> That the love of the Supreme Good, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all goodneſs.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. GOD is our true and ſovereign good, him we muſt love with all our ſoul and ſtrength, and to him we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all our ways. For the love of God comprehends all vertue and godlineſs; it is temperance, whereby we deſpiſe the pride and delights of the World, that God may have our whole hearts to himſelf; it is conſtancy, whereby we patiently bear any croſs for and from God; It is juſtice, whereby we ſerve and obey God alone, and with due moderation command his creatures; it is prudence and the higheſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51153:136"/> wiſdom, whereby we diligently avoid the obſtacles, and uſe the means to come to God; it is all that can make us good, and make us happy. Now God muſt be lov'd for himſelf, for nothing can be better than God; he is infinitely good, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of all goodneſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other things muſt be lov'd only for his ſake, and in ſuch proportion as they are more or leſs related to him: but he muſt be lov'd on his own account, as much as is poſſible, without bounds or meaſures, for his perfections are vaſt enough to ſwallow up all our affections, nay, they infinitely exceed them: ſo that nothing muſt ſhare our love with him, it is all infinitely more than due to him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It much concerns us therefore to be very careful, that thoſe lower ſenſible goods wherewith we converſe in this Earth, do not ſteal our hearts from God the giver of them. For though we ſet the greater value upon things Spiritual and Eternal, yet becauſe now they are out of our ſight and we cannot reach them, our affections to them are dull and heavy, and muſt be forc'd and liſted up: whereas they are brisk and ſwift to ſuch things as are the object of ſenſe, and we naturally fall down to our ſenſual nature, and without great care we cannot avoid to be by it cheated into ſelf-love. If we would therefore be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51153:136"/> repleniſh'd with the Holy and Beatifying Love of God, we muſt firſt caſt the World out of our hearts: for as a full veſſel cannot receive better liquor, except it be emptied, no more can our hearts love the Creator, if they are poſſeſt by creatures. Therefore ſaith Saint <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Apoſtle of <hi>Jeſus, Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, for if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. Worldly things are made for our uſe, and there is in them ſome beauty: but how much more beautiful is he that made them, and made us for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf. <hi>He that ſeeks for happineſs out of God, ſhall never find it: but if we love him above all things, then we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly happy, for he alſo loves us, and his favour is all.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Wherein conſiſts the Love of God.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IT conſiſts chiefly in joyfully ſuffering for God: for Love is a paſſion, and he therefore loves moſt that is moſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: as the Bleſſed Apoſtles returned from the Council rejoycing that they had been worthy to ſuffer ſhame and ſtripes for the name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> There may be much of nature in that tenderneſs of devout affection, and thoſe tears that proceed from it, which are obſerv'd in ſome: but true vertues and ſolid joys do proceed from a Love practical and obediential. For he that truly loves, obeys in all things cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for ſavour not for fear: and if any burthen unpleaſant to the fleſh be laid upon him, Love makes it light and acceptable too: Therefore the Scripture ſaith that Gods Commandments are not grievous, to let us know we are not yet perfect in Love, when we find them grievous and difficult, and that we ſhould pray and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for an increaſe of Charity. The keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Commandments is doubtleſs very hard to them that are acted by fear,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51153:137"/> but <hi>Perfect Love caſteth out Fear:</hi> and as it fulfills the Law, ſo it makes it eaſie and delightful to us. For there is no trouble nor difficulty, in that ſervice which Love obligeth to, what duties it binds on a good ſervant, are ever thought pleaſant, and readily diſcharg'd: whereas the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by fear, will make ſubjection grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and obedience to be cavill'd at, and by ſome means eluded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By this they are convinc'd to want the Love of God, who complain of the ſtrictneſs of Goſpel-precept, and count morality a needleſs burthen, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and objections, ſeek to looſen the yoke, that they may ſhake it off. Such are they that have itching ears, and heap to themſelves teachers after their own heart, ſuch as may more comply with their humor, and inlarge their wanton liberty, by reſtraining Gods Laws and the injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Church. For men now adays will not be held in by duty, but will range according to their will; they have diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves out of meekneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and now that their actions are not govern'd by plain precepts, but by opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and parties, they may be warranted to do, in a manner whatever they luſt. But alaſs, before <hi>Chriſts</hi> dreadful Tribunal, we ſhall not he judged by vulgar opinions, nor by the exceptions of contentious men, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51153:138"/> by truth and by divine Laws. There mens fancies and relaxations, and the doctrine of probability, as ſome do teach it, will be found to hare been only pernicious cheats, whereby men ſought to warrant their looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſobedience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But theſe things are not weighed nor underſtood, but by them that ſincerely love God, and are therefore ready always to obey him, in all things he requires. For 'tis by Love that the Soul gives up her ſelf to God, and by cleaving to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one will and one ſpirit with him: for <hi>God is Love,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. And from this union flows an holy peace, and a delicious joy: when by love we are ſubject to our Beloved, and are poſſeſt of him, in whom and by whom are all things, and who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all happineſs, and the ſatisfaction of all our deſires. Now by this ſhall a man know whether he truly loves God, and adheres to him, if God be the laſt end of all his purpoſes and actions, if his thoughts and deſires always run after him, and if above all things he ſeeks to pleaſe and to obtain him.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLI.</hi> That there is more of Love in Practical Knowledge than in Speculation.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. TO deſire knowledge is natural to man, and ſtill the more he knows, the more that deſire increaſeth, and then he rejoyceth in himſelf, and is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his great learning, when he thinks he knows much, and hath a great inſight into the profoundeſt of divine myſteries, and ſo he comes to love his knowledge more than God the object of it. Thus the Philoſophers, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves them, when they knew God, yet they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imaginations: much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves and their diſcoveries. And thus alſo many Chriſtians value more what they know, and what they can diſcourſe of God and Religion, that they value both him and it. They ſpeak great things of the love of Chriſt, and they love themſelves for ſo ſpeaking. In that knowledge they have of God, as in a mirror, they view themſelves eſpecially, and take little notice of the glaſs; they admire the viſion, their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51153:139"/> own act, more than the object which is ſeen. But God muſt be lov'd and worſhipt in ſpirit and in truth, in ſingleneſs and ſimplicity, without any reſpect to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As a Country-man plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, who daily ſees the Sun, is more in love with the light of it, than a blind Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher who can talk many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature, and the cauſes and effects of light: ſo an honeſt pious man without Scholarſhip, by an active practical Faith, ſhews more love to God, than the profound Divine, by his ſubtleties and high ſpeculations. And as a learned man in Northern Countries, where no Vines can grow, may learnedly diſcourſe of their fruit and the properties of it, and yet not have ſuch an intimate acquaintance with the nature and ſtrength of the wine, as the plain vine-dreſſer that drinks it daily: ſo may a Religious illiterate man have a greater inſight into divine myſteries, and a more reliſhing apprehenſion of them, than many a man of great fame and learning. <hi>For experience goes beyond all theory, and love paſſeth knowledge, and we much ſooner come to God by affection, than by ſtudious inquiries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We muſt not only therefore inform our underſtanding: but if we deſire to love God fervently, we muſt ingage our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51153:139"/> affections and give our ſelves to Prayer. Proficiency in goodneſs will make us know more of God, and to better purpoſe, than proficiency in knowledge. Goodneſs will make us love, and love will bring us into Gods ſecret place, where we ſhall ſee more, and with more delight, than all notional learning can ſhew us. What we can know of God in this our exile, is but little: but we may love him as much as we will, he grants us that power; and as our love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, our labour will grow leſs, and our obedience more perfect. But many had rather ſeek God, whom they never find: than love, and thereby enjoy him.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLII.</hi> That by Love Holineſs is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IT is a commandment of God, both in the Law and the Goſpel, <hi>be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> That is, that we ſhould be pure, and without the unclean mixture of the creatures. For as Lead in Silver, and dirt upon white robes, will debaſe and ſtain: ſo if we ingage our Souls to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51153:140"/> world, to things beneath them, we make them vile and unclean, whereas if we liſt them up to God by a hearty love, we make them pure and beautiful. A heart whence all ſenſual and earthly things are excluded, and whoſe affections cleave to God, by the unions of love, may with joy and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſay with the Apoſtle: <hi>Who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famin, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God; which is in Chriſt</hi> Jeſus <hi>our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8.35.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faſting and Alms, and Corporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, the uſe of Sacraments, and all ſuch means, are great helps towards Sanctity; but they all profit nothing without Charity; No, not Martyrdom it ſelf, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. The exerciſe of ſome other vertues may be ſometimes diſpenc'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: as the poor from Alms-giving, and weak and ſickly people from faſting, and rigorous diſcipline: but to love God and our neighbour, which is the end of all other precepts and the fulfilling of the Law, every one is always oblig'd; no man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51153:140"/> at no time, can be any ways hindred or excuſed; obſtacles and difficulties may ſtop the progreſs of other vertues, but they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Love. Love is within, in the heart and will, there God hath placed it, there God looks for it, and there nothing can obſtruct or ſtifle it, except we will our ſelves. Love alone is neceſſary, and alone ſufficient to make us holy. It is the firſt and great Commandment, pleaſant and eaſie beyond all others: for what more pleaſant than to love? and who dares ſay, I cannot love?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He that heartily loves God who is one, loves all things in one, and one in all things: for he loves not God truly, that loves any thing, which he loves not in God and for God. There is nothing above, there is nothing equal to God: and if at any time we turn our affections from him, they fall upon inferior objects, upon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, whoſe weight doth ſink and preſs them down: and our hearts are never at reſt and liberty, till they return to God, from whom they ungratefully departed. That we may therefore be truly ſanctified, we muſt forſake our ſelves and all created things, and return as high as to that firſt principle of ſanctity, that God from whom we had our origin: and then cleaving ſtedfaſtly to him by a devout love, we ſhall become one with him, in life and holineſs, and felicity.</p>

And yet how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective are we in this? how uncertain is it that we ſhall perſevere? and who can ſearch and ſee into the deep ſecret of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? here the Apoſtle who had been once in Paradiſe, cryes out and wonders, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:51153:141"/> Rom. 11.33. In this great danger and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty every Chriſtian ought exceedingly to fear: and with trembling and an aſſiduous care, indeavour to make his election ſure: living in that Faith which worketh by Love, and declaring by his good works, that he is one of that little but bleſſed number, to whom God will give his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now that that number is but little, compared with the greater multitude of the wicked unhappy world; nay, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the choſen is but ſmall, even of them that profeſs the Goſpel, and are capable of chuſing life or death, we have too many reaſons to believe. And our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour intimates ſo much, when he warns his diſciples of the difficulties of coming into that bleſſed Kingdom of which the entrance is narrow. Mat. 7.13. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads to deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat.</hi> Then he adds, as wondring at this narrowneſs; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Being alſo asked another time, <hi>Lord, are there but few that ſhall be ſaved?</hi> he gives no other anſwer but this, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able.</hi> Luke 13.23. King <hi>David</hi> alſo inquiring, <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle, who ſhall dwell in thy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51153:142"/> holy hill?</hi> the holy Spirit ſuggeſts this anſwer, <hi>he that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 15. And in the twenty fourth Pſalm, he queſtioning again, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord?</hi> he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe anſwered, <hi>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, and hath not lift up his Soul unto vanity.</hi> Now, <hi>who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Prov. 20.9. Who can ſay to <hi>David,</hi> I ſhall, for I work righteouſneſs, and I am innocent?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our Bleſſed Saviour ſaith, Mat. 10.38. <hi>He that taketh not his Croſs and follows after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Now where are they that thus willingly take their Croſs and ſuffer with Chriſt? or rather how ſadly doth St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying fit our Age: <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things which are</hi> Jeſus <hi>Chriſts?</hi> Phil. 2.21. Our Bleſſed Redeemer, who alone hath the keys of Heaven, and knows how we muſt be qualified, before we come thither, affirms, Mat. 18.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Which ſaying if compared with the pride of men, it will be found that but a few by meekneſs and humility, ſeek to become children, to be heirs of the Heavenly Kingdome. It is declar'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.29. <hi>That thoſe whom God foreknew, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son.</hi> But who
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51153:142"/> is the man can boaſt that his life is conform to the Life of Chriſt? and who is he that ſuffers with Chriſt, that he may be with him glorified? It is a ſaying that belongs to all, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Mat. 19.17. <hi>But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, there is none that doth good, no, not one,</hi> Pſal. 14.3. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence</hi> (ſaith the King of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12.) <hi>and the violent take it by force:</hi> Now this violence being againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there are but few that will offer it to themſelves, by forgoing any preſent ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſatisfaction, on the account of that Kingdom which is out of the reach of ſenſe, not now to be enjoyed, but expected only by Faith. If all our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. What are then our ſins and iniquities? <hi>If the Righteous ſcarcely ſhall be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi> 1 Pet. 4.18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. None but eight perſons of the old world, were ſaved with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark; all the reſt of mankind periſht in the floud. <hi>Lot</hi> alone with his wife and two daughters eſcaped the conflagration of the infamous Cities, all the other Inhabitants were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the revenging flames. And of ſix hundred thouſand Jews that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> two only, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> came into the Land of Promiſe. Now thoſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51153:143"/> things were examples, repreſentations of things to come: denoring that the number of thoſe that come to life, is but ſmall, in reſpect of the greater number of ſuch as go to perdition. Which is yet further but too evident, by confidering how moſt men live and die; how few give any certain marks of true contrition. Fear and ſorrow extort groans and good words, and death forceth men to recant, and 'tis much to be feared there is ſeldome any ſincerity in a late death-bed repentance. For how can he begin to live well, that is now dying? how can he heartily deteſt thoſe pleaſures of ſin, which he loved and enjoyed, as long as he liv'd? how hardly will he now he a true penitent, who before abhorred all the mortifications of true penitence? how will his reſolutions be prov'd effectual, if he ſhould eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ape, for the forſaking thoſe ſins, which cuſtom hath made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, and almoſt a ſecond nature? how ſhall now his ſenſual mind lift up it ſelf to thoſe ſpiritual heavenly things, which he before ſeldom or never regarded? and how ſhall he ſtraitned by time and ſad circumſtances, exerciſe thoſe vertues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſins he repents of, to make it appear by his life that there is a change in his heart?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. 'Tis known by experience that very few, when the pains and the danger is over,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51153:143"/> ſtand to thoſe reſolves and promiſes which they made in the day of ſorrow. Generally men forget and are aſham'd afterwards of what they promiſed and reſolv'd: and they ſoon return to their cuſtomary vices and beloved vanities: Eſpecially becauſe there is ſtill a ſecret reſerve in thoſe reſolutions of amendment made in their diſtreſs, there being ſtill ſome hope of an eſcape, till they are at the worſt, and then they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether paſſive, and can act no longer; or at the beſt their ſtrength and rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are ſo weakned, there are ſuch anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fears and trepidations when the Soul is nigh to depart, that men are almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and know not what they do. We may hope well of them, who though they liv'd ill, yet gave ſigns of repentance when they were dying: But this is a deſperate venture, there is much of uncertainty, and nothing of ſafety in their condition. We have a ſad example of this in King <hi>Antiochus;</hi> read <hi>Maccab.</hi> 9. what vows he made, while he was under his grievous ſickneſs. He thought himſelf in earneſt, no doubt, but God knew the unſincerity of his heart, that his repentance proceeded from the fear of death, and <hi>would therefore no more have mercy upon him,</hi> as the text affirms.</p>
                     <p>And who can conſider all this, and not tremble? who will dare to preſume he hath nothing to do, and that his Salvation is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51153:144"/> ſure? who in the midſt of ſo many and ſo great dangers, will dwell as in ſafety, and not watch, and call upon God? therefore becauſe the choſen are few, fewer perhaps than we think, let us not go with the many, nor follow the croud: but let us live with the ſmall ſelect number of truly good and religious Chriſtians, that we may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and confidence, when our life is ended; that we may with an humble and well-grounded hope, look up to God, and expect that gracious reward he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his faithful ſervants, to all that ſincerely love and obey him.</p>
